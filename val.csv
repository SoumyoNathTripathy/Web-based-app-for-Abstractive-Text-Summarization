S0168874X13001339," Human face can be seen as a soft tissue organ complex with a large investing network of musculature . Due to its complexity most existing computational models approximate these muscular structures using simple geometries such as 1 D curves or primitive 3 D shapes . This paper presents a new approach to evaluate muscle contribution from anatomically accurate geometries while maintaining the computational complexity at a tractable level . In the proposed method 3 D muscle structures are embedded inside a facial continuum where mechanical contribution of muscles is evaluated independently and transferred to the facial computational domain through a finite element mapping procedure . Muscle forces are decomposed into an array of discrete point loads that are determined at the integration points of an appropriate quadrature scheme . As a result muscle meshes can be constructed independent from the facial mesh giving two main advantages the muscle geometries can be refined independent of the facial computational domain and it is not required for the computational domain to conform to complex topology of muscle structures . 
",We model the deformation of the human face due to muscle contraction. 3 D muscles with anatomical geometry and fibre orientation is used. Muscle forces are represented as discrete point load at the integration points. Increasing the number of embedded muscles does not increase the degrees of freedom.
S0168874X13000723," In this paper we use a numerical procedure to analyse bifurcation and postbifurcation of inflated hyperelastic thick walled cylinders based on the modified Riks method . In particular the bulging mode of bifurcation is exploited in the context of aneurysm formation with cylindrical geometry in cardiovascular diseases . We focus here on orthotropic materials with two preferred directions which are mechanically equivalent and are symmetrically disposed . Arterial wall tissue is modeled with this class of constitutive equation showing significant stiffening behaviour . The onset of bulging is considered to give aneurysm formation . Analytical solutions can be found in the literature for very particular conditions involving specific material models and loads applied as well as usually a perfect geometry . Here we provide a unified approach to both the prediction of bifurcation and postbifurcation propagation that can be applied to more general conditions . Furthermore we show that bulging instability under the conditions at hand propagates axially in agreement with the propagation of aneurysms in arterial wall tissue .

S0142694X16300229," Modularisation product platforms product families and product configuration are efficient product structuring tactics in mass customisation . Industry needs descriptions of how the engineering should be done in this context . We suggest that key engineering concepts in this field are partitioning logic set of modules interfaces architecture and configuration knowledge . A literature review reveals that methods consider these concepts partly or with different combinations but considering all of them is rare . Therefore a design method known as the Brownfield Process is presented . The method is applied to an industrial case in which the aim was rationalisation of existing product variety towards a modular product family that enables product configuration . We suggest that the method is valuable in cases with similar goals . End users of products can be segmented into different market groups based on the same kind of expectations related to the products . There are companies which are competing for the share of a single or several market segments . When a company has to consider customer segments with changing requirements towards products the cost effectiveness of offering product variants is one challenge . This paper studies this kind of environment . Our research background is familiar with studying companies that operate in projecting business and produce products in small series . In these surroundings the costs of engineering are relatively high in comparison with the cost of producing the product . The case discussed in Section 2 considers similar context . Product variety describes the number of different versions of a product offered by a firm at a single point in time . Companies should be able to respond to different customer needs while keeping their operations profitable . For this challenge modularisation product platforms product families and product configuration are suggested product development tactics which are considered as part of the mass customisation paradigm . Linking modularisation product platform and product family development approaches with product configuration aspects is unusual in design methods although these tactics and their importance are highlighted separately for supporting design reuse and enabling several benefits in the business environment of companies . Consequently there is a need to study how to structure the key engineering concepts in this field and how these concepts could be synthesised in order to support a design situation in which existing product variety should be rationalised towards a modular product family that supports product configuration . The focus is on the existing product variety because for example Oja describes that the designing of a completely new product is rare in the manufacturing industry because of the risks . The paper presents a more advanced method description of our approach to modular product family development compared to the earlier publication . Considering the research method the current situation was analysed first . The original method description did not consider the most relevant modularisation aspects though they were considered in the same industrial case discussed in this paper . This conclusion was supported by. 
",Existing methods in modular product family development are reviewed. Key engineering concepts in this field are suggested. Considering the key engineering concepts in a single design method is rare. Method that considers the key engineering concepts is presented. The method helps defining design information related to the key concepts.

S0168874X13001388," An efficient approach is proposed in order to predict the mechanical response of complex industrial parts . As these structures are usually composed of massive and thin parts different models have to be mixed together . The transition between these different kinematic assumptions can be problematic and non linear models can not be employed depending on the plate model that is considered . Moreover Finite Element analysis in the case of large and complex assemblies implies tedious meshing steps . The idealization and simplification of these structures into a mix of 2D and 3D Finite Elements usually takes therefore significantly more time than the analysis itself . The objective of the present contribution is to explore a calculation process that enables a simple automation of the meshing steps . Even though potentially computationally more expensive the meshing automation may lead to drastic time reduction for the CAD to mesh process and a much tighter link between CAD and calculated assembly . Finally easier and faster design explorations would be allowed . This strategy relies on the use of a non conforming quadratic approximation that is defined on a sufficiently fine mesh . The eXtended Finite Element Method is used in order to alleviate meshing issues . The mesh and Level Set function are built from the CAD input by means of an automated approach . The strategy is verified against analytical solutions and real aerospace substructures . 
",Propose a pragmatic approach for simulating complex industrial parts. Meshing issues avoided thanks to the X FEM. Conversion of the CAD into a Level Set function. Use solid elements in order to treat both slender and massive parts. Encouraging results are shown.
S0168874X13001595," The validity of using the finite element modal analysis in combination with the operational vibration waveforms generated by vehicles to guide structural health monitoring observers in their inspection of old bridges is investigated in this work . A nondestructive vibration based approach operational response and waveform analysis is introduced and used in the process of validating the predictability of the finite element model . In ORWA the frequency domain response of a highway bridge is generated from the operating traffic load and the structural response is visualized and used to develop a holistic view of the bridge s response to automobile loadings . By visualizing the response of the bridge concrete cracking in the abutment and deck is correlated with certain types of structural motion and their corresponding frequencies . Significant excitation frequencies for this particular structure and loading are identified using a frequency domain study of the vibration waveforms generated by vehicle and field results showed similarity with field impact tests conducted on the bridge . The finite element modal analysis of the original CAD drawings of the bridge in combination with the vibration waveforms generated by vehicles spectrum has demonstrated realistic consistency with the findings of ORWA in showing the correlations between the physical damage areas on the bridge and the excited mode shapes of the operational loading that tend to cause these types of damage . 
",FE modal analysis based on vehicle waveforms is consistent with the field results. FE modal analysis of original maps can be used to investigate health of old bridges. Major physical damage on the bridge is mainly associated with the first mode. FE modal analysis based on vehicle waveforms can be used to guide bridge inspectors. Bridge s deterioration is associated with the traffic that excites the first mode.

A cantilever and a doubly clamped beams actuated by an electrostatic force are considered in the paper . The governing partial differential equations for the two cases which account for the nonlinearities are presented . These equations are spatially discretized using the Galerkin finite element method . The resulting system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations is reduced using the trajectory piecewise linear model order reduction method . Simulation indicates that the use of the original TPWLMOR method leads to the presence of a phase error in the long term dynamic simulation of the models .

S0168874X13000590," In modern finite element analysis a mesh is said to be tangled if it contains one or more inverted elements . Tangling can occur for example during mesh optimization and mesh morphing . Modern finite element theory and commercial FEA packages are not designed to handle tangled meshes i.e . they can lead to erroneous results . Researchers and practitioners therefore unanimously recommend untangling prior to analysis . In this paper a new mathematical framework for FEA over tangled meshes is proposed . Specifically by defining a cell decomposition of a tangled mesh and an associated set of cell shape functions it is shown that FEA can be successfully carried out over tangled meshes . The cell shape functions are constructed through an oriented linear combination of the classic element shape functions . Numerical examples illustrate the correctness of the proposed framework . Potential applications of the proposed framework are also illustrated . 
",A new theory is proposed for finite element analysis over a tangled mesh. The theory rests on cell decomposition and cell shape functions. The theory extends continuous Galerkin formulation to a tangled mesh. Numerical results are provided to validate the proposed theory.
S0168874X13000760," Many problems in structural mechanics involve complex principal stress fields that are not orthogonal to the geometric axis of the structure . Such problems are often analysed with finite elements but the quality of a finite element solution may be sensitive to the orientation of the mesh with respect to the principal axes of stress . This paper presents the outline of a procedure to generate well structured inclined quadrilateral finite element meshes for the analysis of thin plate and shell structures . The procedure was developed using the commercial FE pre processor ABAQUS CAE and the Python script language though it may readily be applied in any pre processor which supports an external scripting functionality . A set of mesh convergence studies using linear buckling analyses are presented on four benchmark problems with known analytical solutions to illustrate the effect of inclined meshes on the accuracy of the computed solution . These illustrations are intended to raise an awareness of the subtle but important relationship between mesh and stress field orientation and are presented for the benefit of practising finite element analysts in structural engineering . 
",Analysis of plate and shell structures may involve inclined principal stress fields. Such fields may cause buckling modes that are not orthogonal to the geometric axes. In such cases the finite element solution is sensitive to the mesh orientation. Studies show that rectangular elements subject to pure shear converge more slowly. Highly relevant to shell analysts modelling structures in global shear and torsion.
S0142694X15000137," Interviews were conducted with thirteen professional designers to understand their attitudes towards fixation and the practices they adopt to address it . Fixation was thought to be encouraged and discouraged by a wide range of factors related to the project the client the design team the organisational culture and the design activities employed . The experiences that designers accumulate during their professional lives were associated with fixation in different ways . The experience of prior design failures was thought to encourage fixation whilst the experience of varied solutions was thought to discourage fixation . Recognising fixation episodes and reflecting on them was described as the means by which designers could guard against such episodes in the future and thus be more creative .

S0168874X13000954," A new finite element model for steel concrete side plated beams exposed to mechanical and thermal loading is presented . The moisture and heat transfer through concrete is considered independent on mechanical deformations . The hygro thermo mechanical analysis is performed in two separate steps starting with the moisture and heat transfer analysis and continuing with the mechanical stress strain analysis .

S0168874X13001170," The aim of this work is the numerical study of a crack path in a residual stress field resulting from a manufacturing process such as quenching . An XFEM technique is proposed to that end and the example illustrating the quenching of a large thick plate is considered so as to demonstrate the capability of the method proposed . Indeed during the quenching of steels metallurgical transformations can occur leading to high residual stresses at room temperature . From the practical point of view the thick plate must be sawn after quenching . But it is experimentally observed that under certain quenching conditions the crack initiated by the sawing suddenly propagates through the thickness of the plate and then rotates through an angle of about 90 . The numerical simulation of quenching is detailed and the results obtained under two operating conditions are given . Then the XFEM technique applied to the crack propagation in a residual stress field is presented and the cracking path obtained on the quenched plate is compared to that obtained using the FEM coupled with a remeshing technique . It is shown that the computed crack path justifies experimental observations .

S0167739X13001726," More and more large data collections are gathered worldwide in various IT systems . Many of them possess a networked nature and need to be processed and analysed as graph structures . Due to their size they very often require the usage of a parallel paradigm for efficient computation . Three parallel techniques have been compared in the paper MapReduce its map side join extension and Bulk Synchronous Parallel . They are implemented for two different graph problems calculation of single source shortest paths and collective classification of graph nodes by means of relational influence propagation . The methods and algorithms are applied to several network datasets differing in size and structural profile originating from three domains telecommunication multimedia and microblog . The results revealed that iterative graph processing with the BSP implementation always and significantly even up to 10 times outperforms MapReduce especially for algorithms with many iterations and sparse communication . The extension of MapReduce based on map side join is usually characterized by better efficiency compared to its origin although not as much as BSP .

S0167739X14001630," The execution context in which pervasive systems or mobile computing run changes continually . Hence applications for these systems require support for self adaptation to the continual context changes . Most of the approaches for self adaptive systems implement a reconfiguration service that receives as input the list of all possible configurations and the plans to switch between them . In this paper we present an alternative approach for the automatic generation of application configurations and the reconfiguration plans at runtime . With our approach the generated configurations are optimal as regards different criteria such as functionality or resource consumption . This is achieved by modelling architectural variability at design time using the Common Variability Language and using a genetic algorithm that finds nearly optimal configurations at run time using the information provided by the variability model . We also specify a case study and we use it to evaluate our approach showing that it is efficient and suitable for devices with scarce resources .

S0142694X1500054X," It is essential that graphic design is visually clear and accessible . However evidence suggests that a lack of consideration is given to visual accessibility in print based graphic design . Furthermore effective client designer communication is a vital component in this . This paper investigates current graphic design practice with regard to visual accessibility specifically focussing on client designer communication . A survey of 122 graphic designers and clients identified that these two groups may not be communicating with each other effectively with regard to visual accessibility and that there is a need to develop inclusive design tools to assist them with this . This paper adds a novel contribution to our limited understanding of visual accessibility in the UK s graphic design industry . Inaccessible graphic design is commonplace . From drug packaging to software interfaces it makes daily tasks difficult or even dangerous . Due in part to an ageing population it now is estimated that two million people in the UK have some form of sight loss with many more being affected by milder age related visual problems . Furthermore the introduction of the Disability Discrimination Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act result in strong legal social responsibility and business drivers to ensure that graphic design is visually accessible . However designers report that a lack of client requests for visual accessibility limits the consideration they can give to it . Clients also hold the misconception that designers will take visual accessibility into account even if it is not in the brief . This suggests that designers and clients may not be communicating effectively . A widespread study of the graphic design industry is vital in determining what happens with regard to visual accessibility in practice . This paper presents the results of a survey of the graphic design industry . It investigated the factors that influence how important graphic designers and clients deem visual accessibility to be the extent to which it is considered in practice and the extent to which clients and designers communicate regarding visual accessibility . Inclusive design tools that aid client designer communication could provide an important supplement to existing tools and result in a greater uptake of inclusive design in industry . This paper provides valuable insight into graphic design practice with regard to visual accessibility . It is hoped that this work and subsequent research will help to develop new procedures processes and tools to improve client designer communication and assist graphic designers in creating visually accessible designs .

S0168874X13001042," This paper introduces the Guide Weight method into the topology optimization of continuum structures subjected to body force loads . Given the design dependent characteristic of body forces three main difficulties are encountered when dealing with topology optimization problems under this load condition namely the non monotonous behavior of the compliance inactive volume constraint of the optimum and parasitic effect in low density regions . Numerous researchers have attempted to solve this problem with mathematical programming or heuristic methods but all these methods share the significant weakness of low computational efficiency . Accordingly we propose to solve this problem with an Optimality Criteria method i.e . the GW method . First all theoretical derivations of topology optimization with the GW method are carried out and the iteration procedure with GW is presented . Then some typical examples of withstanding body forces are tested and the topologies got in this paper are compared with corresponding results obtained by former researchers . The iteration speed is found to improve significantly when utilizing the GW method to deal with this kind of problems . Finally considering all the above examples are optimized with SIMP model we try to combine RAMP model with the GW method . The distinction between the models of SIMP and RAMP when using GW to solve topology optimization problems under body forces are investigated which indicates that although both these two interpolation models are able to yield very similar optimal results if suitable parameters are chosen there is more superiority for RAMP model to get clearer topologies .

S0168874X1300139X," Magnesium and its alloys have been increasingly used in the automotive industry owning to their superior mechanical compared to other metals . Sheet forming of Mg alloys requires not only a good understanding of the materials but also an appropriate material model . The hardening behavior of Mg alloy sheets during plastic deformation is the main concern in tool design and product manufacturing processes . A simple but computationally effective constitutive model is suggested to predict the mechanical behavior of Mg alloy sheets .

S0168874X13001352," In the past structural model updating methods have been widely researched as a means to reconcile mathematical models because the key parameters in dynamic systems often change during their life cycle due to repair and replacement of parts or the environment . However there is very little literature that references model updating under the condition of complicated multi physics fields such as a high temperature environment . In this paper model updating in an HTE is proposed based on the hierarchical method and an iterative procedure is presented . With this method the temperature field updating of a structure is taken as the first stage and the multi objective optimization method and a surrogate model of radial basis functions are introduced to improve the robustness and efficiency of this stage respectively . Then the temperature distribution achieved from the former is imposed on the structure as a thermal load and the residuals of the modal characteristics are taken as objective functions to update the dynamic model of the structure in HTE . The proposed method is tested on an FE model of a wing model and the analysis of variance approach is employed to evaluate the parameter variability significance and to select the updating variable .

S0168874X13000747," The effect of various p method finite element model parameters on the prediction of planar crack front geometry in three dimensional structures is evaluated . An automatic crack growth method was developed using the commercial software StressCheck coupled with Microsoft Excel . The geometry of the evolving crack front was predicted using iterations of three dimensional finite element models to determine the stress intensity values at discrete points along the crack front and incrementing the crack length locally using the Paris growth law . Modeling parameters such as the global mesh size p level crack tip mesh size and the extraction radius used for determining the stress intensity factors were all considered . The effect of these parameters on the predicted shape of a growing elliptical crack front was evaluated through a series of simulations of a corner crack emanating from a centered hole in a plate . A single model of a through crack with a straight crack front was also used to compare the effects of the model parameters on a different geometric configuration . This study has shown that the corner crack geometry and the growth series are more sensitive to the number of elements along the crack front and the extraction radius than the through thickness crack . In addition convergence of the predicted crack front geometry does not guarantee convergence of the distribution of stress intensity factors along the crack front . It was also determined that for the models considered using a smaller overall mesh size is a more effective way of decreasing discretization error than increasing the p level . 
",K is calculated more accurately at free surfaces using smaller extraction radii. Corner crack results are dependent on the number of elements along the crack front. Predicted crack front geometry depends on the shape of the K profile along the crack front. High p levels do not necessarily compensate for a coarse mesh. The energy norm should not be used as the sole indicator of solution convergence.
S0167739X14002465," Wireless Mesh Sensor Networks have recently received a great deal of attention in the scientific and developers communities due to the significant advances of this technology in the wireless communication field . The main reason was that competing WMSN approaches that emerged in the last few years provide mesh capabilities to conventional WSN based applications encouraging researchers and end users to adopt new perspectives and solutions . Unfortunately each one of these approaches lacks some of the aforementioned mesh capabilities not assuring a priori the feasibility and especially the long term stability of WMSN applications . The IEEE 802.15.5 standard and in particular its Asynchronous Energy Saving mode was conceived to fill this gap since it integrates in a single solution most of these capabilities guaranteeing among other benefits a long network lifetime . However the ASES mode has no built in mechanisms to mitigate the negative effects of hidden terminals which sharply degrades the network performance . This fact leads us to conclude that any current WMSN approach is non exempt of some problem which prevents the definitive boost of this technology in the consumer market . Under these circumstances our contribution to the WMSN field in this paper is a twofold proposal addressed to alleviating the hidden terminal problems in a scenario running under the most relevant design premises of ASES mode . Therefore we first formulate a multi objective optimization and then solve it by using Goal Programming . Both mathematical techniques are applied to obtain the best solution that simultaneously minimizes the aggregate message collision time due to hidden terminals and maximizes the network lifetime . Secondly we propose the design of a MULti channel TIme scheduled algorithm for the HIdden Terminal problem avoidance which appropriately exploits the available bandwidth and accomplishes a straightforward coordination between any sender receiver pair . Finally the analysis and simulation experiments are presented and their results carefully discussed demonstrating the effectiveness of both proposals in the WMSN arena . 
",WMSN approaches offer new perspectives to conventional WSN based applications. Among WMSN proposals the ASES mode guarantees the most relevant mesh capabilities. ASES has no mechanisms to mitigate the negative effects of hidden terminals HT . Under ASES rules we propose an optimization model and a multi channel time slotted algorithm to alleviate the HT problem. An intensive performance evaluation study is discussed to validate our proposals.
S0168874X13002011," In order to enhance the crash characteristics and geometrical accuracy components hot formed in a fully martensitic state have gained in the last few years more and more importance . However the very high strength exhibited by these components makes subsequent operations such as cutting difficult due to the high process forces and associated high wear of the cutting tools . Moreover for some applications such as B pillars and other automotive components that may undergo impact loading it may be desirable to create regions of the part with softer and more ductile microstructures .

The current 10 year plan is outlined by the Hyogo Framework for Action . Established in 2005 it seeks to establish resilience at all levels of society through the systematic integration of risk reduction into policy . It aims to achieve this by addressing the following strategic goals and priorities governance assessment and monitoring knowledge and education risk factors and disaster preparedness and response . Disaster preparedness at individual household and community levels is a fundamental component of resilience and can be defined as the process of encouraging availability of resources to facilitate coping and the systems and competencies to coordinate and utilize these resources . It plays a particularly important role in coping and adaptation during the immediate aftermath of a natural hazard when individuals and communities are expected to be self reliant for a minimum of 72 h .

This is predominantly accomplished through one way communication that takes the form of distribution of printed material aimed at a homogeneous audience . The material commonly emphasizes actions individuals can perform to protect themselves .

Current codes generally encounter difficulties for modelling this fabrication process because of the size of industrial mills . Indeed accurate modelling of the continuous cold roll forming process using finite elements requires a huge number of elements leading to excessive CPU times . Therefore modellers usually reduce the geometry of the formed sheet or increase the size of the finite elements inducing a loss of accuracy in the results . In this work the finite element software METAFOR is used to model cold roll forming of channel profiles made of high strength and stainless steels . The numerical results expressed in terms of corner strength enhancement versus radius to thickness ratio are compared against an existing predictive model .

Roll forming is a continuous bending process during which the thin sheet of metal is successively passed through a set of rolls that incrementally bend it until the desired cross section is obtained . The movement of the sheet through successive combinations of rollers produces the final cross section . During cold rolling the profile undergoes successive states of deformation according to the flower pattern . This process of fabrication implies longitudinal stresses as well as relatively high shear stresses . Consequently the goal of the manufacturer is to find a good combination of successive rollers distance between rollers and speed of rotation to minimise the undesired deformation such as cross sectional distortion or buckling waves in the flats . In press braking a semi manual forming process during which the sheet of metal is bent via a punch onto a die strength enhancement is restricted to corner regions while in roll forming there may also be moderate gain in the flat regions given that longitudinal forces occurring during the forming process may be relatively high and thus lead to plastic straining . The finite element method is regarded by.

Among other techniques the use of Enhanced Assumed Strain methods can lead to formulations that yield good results although sometimes computationally expensive .

S0168874X13000814," A robust reduced integration solid shell finite element in irreducible variational formulation is demonstrated in this paper . To enable shell element like performance using a single through shell thickness element layer we apply element technologies isotropically introducing local tri quadratic hierarchical displacement modes thereafter systematically projected to the global coordinate frame . We also enforce uniform bilinear and linear ANS interpolations to all local normal and shear strains respectively imposing identical in plane and out of plane element response for robust 3D thin shell deformation behaviour in non regular trapezoidal shaped meshes . The hierarchical strains realised improve the element performance by complementing the locking alleviating actions of the ANS modified membrane and shear strain fields in reduced numerical integration scheme performed along the designated shell thickness . We restrict our initial numerical investigations to geometrically linear beams plates and shell problems solely for preliminary assessment of the element s in plane and out of plane behaviour in response to the uniform modification of strains and hierarchical displacement modes introduced .

S0168874X13001315," A hybrid finite element formulation is used to model temperature evolutions in concrete structures at early ages taking into account the thermo chemical process of cement hydration . The most relevant fields in the application problem namely the temperature and the hydration degree fields are selected for direct and independent approximation . The Galerkin formulation used qualifies as hybrid because the heat flux is also approximated on the boundary of the element . The temperature and hydration degree bases are used to enforce the thermal equilibrium condition and the hydration law respectively and the heat flux basis is used to enforce the thermal continuity conditions . The resulting nonlinear transient hybrid formulation leads to high degree naturally hierarchical elements .

S0168874X13000449," An approach based on mechanical testing and finite element modeling is presented to establish the stress strain relationship for polymers when necking evolves under tension . The paper gives details of criteria used for evaluating the stress strain relationship during the necking process and depicts how the total strain range is divided into several sections for the ease of the iterative calculation process . High density polyethylene is used as a sample polymer to illustrate the approach . The results show that this approach can consider non linear and creep deformation during the neck evolvement and the stress strain relationship established can be applied to a finite element model to regenerate force elongation curve and cross section reduction measured from the mechanical testing . Polymers such as high density polyethylene are susceptible to spontaneous strain localization and strain hardening that arises from structural rejuvenation induced by large deformation . In view that the ability to predict necking in polymers is essential for assurance of their reliable performance especially when considering applications such as pipelines and pressure vessels understanding such deformation behavior is of utmost importance . As a result much of the research work on polymers has been dedicated to study of the necking behavior and the damage evolution process during the neck development . However challenges are encountered due to the time dependent deformation process that plays a critical role for many polymers in long term service . As a result most of the characterization methods to evaluate reliability of the long term performance of polymers require tests on full sized products . Since those tests are time consuming to carry out and involve significant uncertainty in its prediction accuracy some researchers have considered a different approach that is to evaluate the performance through numerical simulation for which the first step is to establish the stress strain relationship for the deformation process . During the last few decades many approaches have been proposed to establish the stress strain relationship for polymer deformation . Some of those approaches often known as slip link or tube models are an extension from classical rubber elasticity to consider chain entanglements in the molecular network for the mechanical response during the deformation . One of those approaches commonly known as Edward Vilgis theory separates number of permanent joints from number of topological constraints in the expression of free energy as a function of stretch ratio . Based on this model formation of cross links in radiated polyethylene was investigated and found to increase the effective chain entanglements during the deformation . Other approaches consider interactions at the molecular level to relate the molecular interactions with the macroscopic deformation behavior . One of the first models in those approaches took into account rotation and alignment of molecular chain segments for establishing the stress strain relationship for large deformation in amorphous polymers . The model was later extended to three dimensional deformation . More recently Wu and Buckley developed a model based on molecular interaction to capture. 
",Testing and FEM were used to establish the constitutive equation for necking in polymers. Creep is included in the constitutive equation in order to regenerate the necking behavior. Constitutive equation is established for HDPE in two specimen geometries at two cross head speeds.

S0168874X1400184X," The paper proposes a mixed finite element model and experiments its capability in the analysis of elastic and plastic collapse plane problems . The model is easy to formulate and implement because it is based on simple assumptions for the unknown fields . A composite triangular mesh is assumed over the domain . Within each triangular element the displacement field is described by a quadratic interpolation while the stress field is represented by a piece wise constant description by introducing a subdivision of the element into three triangular regions . The elastic solution is constructed through the stationarity condition of the mixed Hellinger Reissner functional . The plastic collapse analysis is formulated as a mathematical programming problem and is accomplished by an Interior Point algorithm which furnishes both the collapse multiplier and the collapse mechanism . A series of numerical experiments shows that the proposed model performs well in elastic problems and achieves the favorite context in plastic analysis where it takes advantage of the absence of volumetric locking and the piecewise constant interpolation of the stress field within the element . 
",The model is particularly simple and easy to implement. Nevertheless the element proves to be accurate and robust in the analysis of both elastic and plastic problems. The choice of the displacement and stress interpolations produces an isostatic element which keeps out zero energy modes. The element is locking free. The assumed piece wise constant description of the stress field allows the discontinuities inherent in the plastic solution. The numerical experiments which refer to the analysis of elastic problems and plastic collapse states show that the element furnishes stable results for both regular and irregular meshes also with marked distortions. The element can be extended saving the relevant features to the context of three dimensional analysis.

S0168874X1400033X," This paper presents a novel finite element model for the fully material and geometrical nonlinear analysis of shear deformable two layer composite planar beam column members with interlayer slips . We adopt the co rotational approach where the motion of the element is decomposed into two parts a rigid body motion which defines a local co ordinate system and a small deformational motion of the element relative to this local co ordinate system . The main advantage of this approach is that the transformation matrices relating local and global quantities are independent from the choice of the geometrical linear local element . The effect of transverse shear deformation of the layers is taken into account by assuming that each layer behaves as a Timoshenko beam element . The layers are assumed to be continuously connected and partial interaction is considered by adopting a continuous relationship between the interface shear flow and the corresponding slip .

S0168874X1400122X," The direct time domain analysis of five layered damped sandwich beams subject to impulse load using the discrete Hilbert transform may lead to the unstable growth in damped time responses owing to the incorrectness of Hilbert transformed imaginary impulse force and the insufficient time duration of applied impulse force . To resolve this problem a time domain analysis method making use of the Hilbert transform superposition and the time duration extension is introduced in this paper . The incorrect imaginary impulse force near the end of time period which is caused by the fact that the discrete Hilbert transform using Fourier transform considers the impulse force as a periodic function is resolved by dividing the external impulse force into a finite number of rectangular impulses . And the sufficient time duration of applied impulse force is estimated by a Newton Raphson based iterative residual method . The validity of the present method is justified from the numerical experiment for analyzing the time response of five layered damped sandwich beam .

S0168874X1500061X," A mixed finite element model has been derived for the acoustic analysis of perforated dissipative silencers including several effects simultaneously High temperature and thermal gradients in the central duct and the outer absorbent material a perforated passage carrying non uniform axial mean flow . For such a combination the properties of sound propagation media and flow are inhomogeneous and vary with position . The material of the outer chamber can be modelled by its complex equivalent acoustic properties which completely determine the propagation of sound waves in the air contained in the absorbent medium . Temperature gradients introduce variations in these properties that can be evaluated through a heterogeneous temperature dependent resistivity in combination with material models obtained at room temperature . A pressure based wave equation for stationary medium is then used with the equivalent density and speed of sound of the absorbent material varying as functions of the spatial coordinates . Regarding the central air passage a wave equation in terms of acoustic velocity potential can be used to model the non uniform moving medium since the presence of temperature variations introduce not only heterogeneous acoustic properties of the air but also a gradient in the mean flow velocity . The acoustic connection between the central passage and the outer chamber is given by the acoustic impedance of the perforated duct . This impedance depends on the heterogeneous properties of the absorbent material and the non uniform mean flow leading to a spatial variation of the acoustic coupling and also to additional convective terms in the governing equations . The results presented show the influence of temperature thermal gradients and mean flow on the transmission loss of automotive silencers . It has been found that high temperature and thermal induced heterogeneity can have a significant influence on the acoustic attenuation of an automotive silencer and so should be included in theoretical models . In some particular configurations it may be relatively accurate to approximate the temperature field by using a uniform profile with an average value specially for low resistivity materials . It has been shown however that this is not always possible and attenuation overestimation is likely to be predicted mainly for high radial thermal gradients and high material flow resistivities if the temperature distribution is not taken into account . 
",Dissipative silencers including high temperature and thermal gradients are analysed. A mixed finite element model combining velocity potential and acoustic pressure is derived. Temperature gradients lead to spatial variations of absorbent material properties mean flow and perforated duct impedance. Attenuation overestimation is likely to be predicted if the temperature distribution is not taken into account.
S0168874X1500089X," Triaxial compression of elastoplastic particles was studied with numerical and analytical methods in order to develop a mechanistic model for their interactions at high relative densities . The introduction of an equivalent particle radius that accounted for the elastic volumetric deformation enabled an almost perfect reduction of the results obtained for elastoplastic particles to those obtained for rigid perfectly plastic ones . This in turn made possible a simplified yet mechanistic analytical analysis of the particle response in terms of the contact area pressure and force . The developed model exhibited a good agreement with the numerical results especially for intermediate and large strains and hence laid the foundations for the development of mechanistic contact models suitable for simulations of granular materials at high relative densities with the Discrete Element Method .

S0168874X1500116X," In this paper 4 node quadrilateral and 3 node triangular solid shell elements are applied to drape simulations . With locking issues alleviated by the assumed natural strain method and plane stress enforcement static and dynamic drape problems are attempted by the quadrilateral element . If the drape is deep and the mesh density is inadequate non realistic sharp folds are predicted due to the non physical interpenetration of top and bottom element surfaces . To avoid the interpenetration a reversible adaptive subdivision based on the 1 4 splitting method is developed . To ensure displacement compatibility among elements at different subdivision levels macro transition elements are formed by quadrilateral and triangular solid shell elements . To reduce the dynamic oscillation induced by newly inserted nodes the discrete Kirchhoff condition is employed to determine the related nodal variables .

S0168874X1500013X," A family of spatial beam finite elements based on the fixed pole approach is developed and presented in this work . The family consists of three different interpolation options which arise as a consequence of the fact that the virtual position vector has been interpolated in a non linear manner and depends on the actual position vector not only at the nodal points but also at the integration points . All three formulations turn out to be non invariant and path dependent . In two of them however this problem may be easily solved by interpolating the total local rotations which also makes the procedure more robust in handling large load increments . The topic of this paper is the development of a family of spatial beam finite elements based on the geometrically exact beam theory given by Reissner for 2D beams and extended to 3D beams by Simo . Implementation of this theory in a finite element framework becomes non trivial because of the properties of rotations in 3D . These are defined by orientation matrices elements of a special orthogonal group SO which is also a Lie group . By definition a Lie group is also a differentiable manifold and in order for the solution to stay on the manifold we must acknowledge existence of the so called exponential map a specific operation between a Lie group and a related Lie algebra . This theory was first implemented by Simo and Vu Quoc interpolating the infinitesimal rotations the so called spin vectors . Similar results can be obtained interpolating the incremental rotational changes as proposed by Cardona and G radin or the total rotations as given in . The additive interpolation of any of these rotational fields was shown to be the source of non invariance of strain measures with respect to a rigid motion while Romero thoroughly examined and discussed how different interpolations affect the invariance properties . An invariant formulation was proposed in which not only solved the problem of non invariance of the strain measures but also the problem of path dependence which also existed in some of those formulations by interpolating only the relative rotations between specific nodes i.e . the rotations from which the rigid rotation is removed . In a different vein Betsch and Steinmann have proposed a formulation where interpolation of the rotational degrees of freedom is circumvented by reparametrising the orientation matrix using and interpolating its base triad while Zupan and Saje developed a finite element where the strain vectors are interpolated . In this work we want to shed more light on the fascinating and highly promising fixed pole concept and investigate alternative options of its implementation into the geometrically exact 3D beam theory to those currently available . In the context of this theory the fixed pole concept was first introduced by Borri and Bottasso in 1994 and thoroughly researched in a series of subsequent papers . In the context of simple material and polar material elastomechanics the concept. 
",We analyse fixed pole approach in geometrically exact beam theory. We propose a new formulation using standard degrees of freedom. We assess the new formulation with respect to invariance and path dependence.
S0168874X1500058X," A new adaptive multiscale method is developed based on the estimate of residual forces for static analysis of heterogeneous materials . The AMM is established by combining multi node extended multiscale finite element method with a new proposed macroscopic node adaptive algorithm . In our previous multiscale computations macroscopic nodes are placed uniformly along each edge of multi node coarse element without considering local strain or displacement gradient . In this paper to optimize the distribution of macroscopic nodes a new adaptive algorithm is proposed based on the estimate of residual forces . Numerical experiments have indicated that residual forces exist even for linear elastic problems . For boundary external loading cases residual forces only exist on the edges of coarse element . Besides computations indicate that residual forces can reflect local relative errors in the multi node EMsFEM computations . Thus it is reasonable and suitable to take residual forces as local relative error indicators in the multi node EMsFEM computations . Finally the AMM is developed based on this idea . To verify the validity of this proposed method three typical numerical examples are carried out . The examples demonstrate that nearly optimal distributions of macroscopic nodes can be obtained by employing the proposed AMM .
