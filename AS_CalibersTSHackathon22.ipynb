Methods The nca feature of ncappc package estimates the NCA metrics by NCA . The ppc feature of ncappc estimates the NCA metrics from multiple sets of simulated concentration time data and compares them with those estimated from the observed data . The diagnostic analysis is performed at the population as well as the individual level . The distribution of the simulated population means of each NCA metric is compared with the corresponding observed population mean . The individual level comparison is performed based on the deviation of the mean of any NCA metric based on simulations for an individual from the corresponding NCA metric obtained from the observed data . The ncappc package also reports the normalized prediction distribution error of the simulated NCA metrics for each individual and their distribution within a population . Results The ncappc produces two default outputs depending on the type of analysis performed i.e . NCA and PopPK diagnosis . The PopPK diagnosis feature of ncappc produces 8 sets of graphical outputs to assess the ability of a population model to simulate the concentration time profile of a drug and thereby evaluate model adequacy .

This study included 16 young female patients with vasovagal syncope and 12 age matched female controls . The subjects were enrolled in a head up tilt test breathing normally including 5min of baseline and 18min of 70 orthostatic phase . To increase the time resolution of the analysis the time series were segmented in five minute overlapping windows with a shift of 1min . Hemodynamic parameters did not show any statistical differences between SYN and CON . Time domain linear analysis revealed increased respiratory frequency and increased blood pressure variability in patients during OP meaning increased sympathetic activity and vagal withdrawal . Frequency domain analysis confirmed a predominance of sympathetic tone by steadily increased values of low over high frequency power in BBI and of low frequency power in SYS and DIA in patients during OP . The nonlinear analysis by symbolic dynamics seemed to be highly suitable for differentiation of SYN and CON in the early beginning of OP i.e . 5min after tilt up .

However two dimensional ultrasound images capture only an incomplete portion of the acetabular shape and the alpha and beta angles measured on 2DUS for the Graf classification technique show high inter scan and inter observer variability . This variability relates partly to the manual determination of the apex point separating the acetabular roof from the ilium during index measurement . This study proposes a new 2DUS image processing technique for semi automated tracing of the bony surface followed by automatic calculation of two indices a contour based alpha angle and a new modality independent quantitative rounding index . The new index M is independent of the apex point and can be directly extended to 3D surface models . Methods We tested the proposed indices on a dataset of 114 2DUS scans of infant hips aged between 4 and 183 days scanned using a 12MHz linear transducer . We calculated the manual alpha angle coverage contour based alpha angle and rounding index for each of the recordings and statistically evaluated these indices based on regression analysis area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and analysis of variance . Results Processing time for calculating and M was similar to manual alpha angle measurement 30s per image . Reliability of the new indices was high with inter observer intraclass correlation coefficients 0.90 for and 0.89 for M. For a diagnostic test classifying hips as normal or dysplastic AUC was 93.0 for vs. 92.7 for 91.6 for M alone and up to 95.7 for combination of M with or coverage .

Proof of principle was tested by applying mPCA to model basic peri oral expressions approximated to the junction between the mouth lips . Monte Carlo simulations were used to create this data which allowed exploration of practical implementation issues such as the number of landmark points number of images and number of groups . To further test the robustness of the method mPCA was subsequently applied to a dental imaging dataset utilising landmark points along the boundary of mandibular cortical bone in panoramic radiographs of the face . Results Changes of expression that varied between groups were modelled correctly at one level of the model and changes in lip width that varied within groups at another for the Monte Carlo dataset . Extreme cases in the test dataset were modelled adequately by mPCA but not by standard PCA . Similarly variations in the shape of the cortical bone were modelled by one level of mPCA and variations between the experts at another for the panoramic radiographs dataset . Results for mPCA were found to be comparable to those of standard PCA for point to point errors via miss one out testing for this dataset .

This paper presents the extension of NPF framework for sharpening and edge enhancement of mammogram lesions . Proposed NPF serves to provide enhancement of edges and sharpness of the lesion region in mammograms in a manner to minimize the dependencies on pre selected thresholds . In the present work Logarithmic Image Processing model has been employed for the purpose of improvement in visualization of mammograms based on Human Visual System characteristics . Results The proposed NPF filtering framework yields mammograms with significant improvement in contrast edges as well as sharpness of the lesion region . The performance of the proposed approach has been validated using state of art objective evaluation measures like Contrast Improvement Index Peak Signal to Noise Ratio Average Signal to Noise Ratio and Combined Enhancement Measure as well as subjective evaluation by radiologists opinions . Conclusions The proposed NPF provides a robust solution to perform noise controlled contrast as well as edge enhancement using a single filtering model . This leads to a better visualization of the fine lesion details predictive of their severity . The applicability of single filtering methodology for carrying out denoising contrast and edge enhancement improves the worth of the overall framework . \\n'],\n",
              " [' Background Diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of liver cancer and these two diseases are among the most common and important causes of morbidity and mortality in Taiwan . Purpose To use data mining techniques to develop a model for predicting the development of liver cancer within 6 years of diagnosis with type II diabetes . Methods Data were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan which covers approximately 22 million people . In this study we selected patients who were newly diagnosed with type II diabetes during the 2000 2003 periods with no prior cancer diagnosis . We then used encrypted personal ID to perform data linkage with the cancer registry database to identify whether these patients were diagnosed with liver cancer . Finally we identified 2060 cases and assigned them to a case group and a control group . The risk factors were identified from the literature review and physicians suggestion then chi square test was conducted on each independent variable for a comparison between patients with liver cancer and those without those found to be significant were selected as the factors . We subsequently performed data training and testing to construct artificial neural network and logistic regression prediction models . The dataset was randomly divided into 2 groups a training group and a test group . The training group consisted of 1442 cases and the prediction model was developed on the basis of the training group . The remaining 30 were assigned to the test group for model validation . Results The following 10 variables were used to develop the ANN and LR models sex age alcoholic cirrhosis nonalcoholic cirrhosis alcoholic hepatitis viral hepatitis other types of chronic hepatitis alcoholic fatty liver disease other types of fatty liver disease and hyperlipidemia . The performance of the ANN was superior to that of LR according to the sensitivity specificity and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve . After developing the optimal prediction model we base on this model to construct a web based application system for liver cancer prediction which can provide support to physicians during consults with diabetes patients . Conclusion In the original dataset 33 of diabetes patients were diagnosed with liver cancer . After using 70 of the original data to training the model and other 30 for testing the sensitivity and specificity of our model were 0.757 and 0.755 respectively this means that 75.7 of diabetes patients can be predicted correctly to receive a future liver cancer diagnosis and 75.5 can be predicted correctly to not be diagnosed with liver cancer . These results reveal that this model can be used as effective predictors of liver cancer for diabetes patients after discussion with physicians they also agreed that model can assist physicians to advise potential liver cancer patients and also helpful to decrease the future cost incurred upon cancer treatment . \\n'],\n",

It is well known that only a projective reconstruction could be achieved without any prior information . Here the known segment lengths are exploited to upgrade the projective reconstruction to a Euclidean reconstruction and simultaneously calibrate the intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters . At first a DLT like algorithm for the Euclidean upgrading from segment lengths is derived in a very simple way . Although the intermediate results in the DLT like algorithm are essentially equivalent to the quadric of segments the DLT like algorithm is of higher accuracy than the existing linear algorithms derived from the QoS because of a more accurate way to extract the plane at infinity from the intermediate results . Then to further improve the accuracy of Euclidean upgrading two weighted DLT like algorithms are presented by weighting the linear constraint equations in the original DLT like algorithm . Finally using the results of these linear algorithms as the initial values a new weighted nonlinear algorithm for Euclidean upgrading is explored to recover the Euclidean structure more accurately .

              " ['Recent research emphasizes more on analyzing multiple features to improve face recognition FR performance. One popular scheme is to extend the sparse representation based classification framework with various sparse constraints. Although these methods jointly study multiple features through the constraints they just process each feature individually such that they overlook the possible high level relationship among different features. It is reasonable to assume that the low level features of facial images such as edge information and smoothed low frequency image can be fused into a more compact and more discriminative representation based on the latent high level relationship. FR on the fused features is anticipated to produce better performance than that on the original features since they provide more favorable properties. Focusing on this we propose two different strategies which start from fusing multiple features and then exploit the dictionary learning DL framework for better FR performance. The first strategy is a simple and efficient two step model which learns a fusion matrix from training face images to fuse multiple features and then learns class specific dictionaries based on the fused features. The second one is a more effective model requiring more computational time that learns the fusion matrix and the class specific dictionaries simultaneously within an iterative optimization procedure. Besides the second model considers to separate the shared common components from class specified dictionaries to enhance the discrimination power of the dictionaries. The proposed strategies which integrate multi feature fusion process and dictionary learning framework for FR realize the following goals 1 exploiting multiple features of face images for better FR performances 2 learning a fusion matrix to merge the features into a more compact and more discriminative representation 3 learning class specific dictionaries with consideration of the common patterns for better classification performance. We perform a series of experiments on public available databases to evaluate our methods and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models. \\n'],\n",

              " ['This paper focuses on activity recognition when multiple views are available. In the literature this is often performed using two different approaches. In the first one the systems build a 3D reconstruction and match that. However there are practical disadvantages to this methodology since a sufficient number of overlapping views is needed to reconstruct and one must calibrate the cameras. A simpler alternative is to match the frames individually. This offers significant advantages in the system architecture e.g. it is easy to incorporate new features and camera dropouts can be tolerated . In this paper the second approach is employed and a novel fusion method is proposed. Our fusion method collects the activity labels over frames and cameras and then fuses activity judgments as the sequence label. It is shown that there is no performance penalty when a straightforward weighted voting scheme is used. In particular when there are enough overlapping views to generate a volumetric reconstruction our recognition performance is comparable with that produced by volumetric reconstructions. However if the overlapping views are not adequate the performance degrades fairly gracefully even in cases where test and training views do not overlap. \\n'],\n",

In this work we propose a new GPU accelerated method for Compton camera reconstruction which is more accurate by using exactly matched pair of projector and backprojector . Methods To calculate conic forward projection we first sample the cone surface into conic rays and accumulate the intersecting chord lengths of the conic rays passing through voxels using a fast ray tracing method . For conic backprojection to obtain the true adjoint of the conic forward projection while retaining the computational efficiency of the GPU we use a voxel driven RTM which is essentially the same as the standard RTM used for the conic forward projector .

Previous studies addressing this issue have mainly focused on investigating chromatic cues to characterize visually salient image regions while less attention has been devoted to monochromatic cues . The purpose of this paper is the study of monochromatic cues which have the potential to complement chromatic cues for the detection of ROIs in an image . This paper first presents a taxonomy of existing ROI detection approaches using monochromatic cues ranging from well known algorithms to the most recently published techniques . We then propose a novel monochromatic cue for ROI detection . Finally a comparative evaluation has been conducted on large scale challenging test sets of real world natural scenes . Experimental results demonstrate that the use of our proposed monochromatic cue yields a more accurate identification of ROIs . This paper serves as a benchmark for future research on this particular topic and a steppingstone for developers and practitioners interested in adopting monochromatic cues to ROI detection systems and methodologies . \\n'],\n",
              " ['Concurrently obtaining an accurate robust and fast global registration of multiple 3D scans is still an open issue for modern 3D modeling pipelines especially when high metric precision as well as easy usage of high end devices structured light or laser scanners are required. Various solutions have been proposed either heuristic iterative and or closed form solutions which present some compromise concerning the fulfillment of the above contrasting requirements. Our purpose here compared to existing reference solutions is to go a step further in this perspective by presenting a new technique able to provide improved alignment performance even on large datasets both in terms of number of views and or point density of range images. Relying on the Optimization on a Manifold OOM approach originally proposed by Krishnan et al. we propose a set of methodological and computational upgrades that produce an operative impact on both accuracy robustness and computational performance compared to the original solution. In particular always basing on an unconstrained error minimization over the manifold of rotations instead of relying on a static set of point correspondences our algorithm updates the optimization iterations with a dynamically modified set of correspondences in a computationally effective way leading to substantial improvements in terms of registration accuracy and convergence trend. Other proposed improvements are directed to a substantial reduction of the computational load without sacrificing the alignment performance. Stress tests with increasing view misalignment allowed us to appreciate the convergence robustness of the proposed solution. Eventually we demonstrate that for very large datasets a further computational speedup can be reached by the adoption of a hybrid local heuristic followed by global optimization registration approach. \\n'],\n",

We describe an alternative adaptive geomasking method referred to as Adaptive Areal Elimination .

In addition to the masked points K anonymized areas can be safely disclosed as well without increasing the risk of re identification . Using a burglary dataset from Vienna AAE is compared with an existing adaptive geographical mask the donut mask . The masking methods are evaluated for preserving a predefined K anonymity and the spatial characteristics of the original points . The spatial characteristics are assessed with four measures of spatial error displaced distance correlation coefficient of density surfaces hotspots divergence and clusters specificity . Masked points from point aggregation of AAE have the highest spatial error in all the measures but the displaced distance . In contrast masked points from the donut mask are displaced the least preserve the original spatial clusters better have the highest clusters specificity and correlation coefficient of density surfaces .

First we develop a model of geometric urban networks that posits a positive relationship between connectivity and size . Empirical evidence is then presented validating the model prediction that local links exhibit super linear scaling with the exponent greater than 1 while long range connections scale linearly with the unit exponent . The scaling exponents thus suggest that the impact of population size on connectivity is stronger within cities than between cities . We next combine the geometric framework with a computational model of interacting agents to generate a realistic settlement distribution and urban networks from the bottom up .

For an input image firstly the method calculates a coarse probability map .

Previous pain vs no pain systems have highlighted two major challenges ground truth is provided for the sequence but the presence or absence of the target expression for a given frame is unknown and the time point and the duration of the pain expression event in each video are unknown . To address these issues we propose a novel framework where each sequence is represented as a bag containing multiple segments and multiple instance learning is employed to handle this weakly labeled data in the form of sequence level ground truth . These segments are generated via multiple clustering of a sequence or running a multi scale temporal scanning window and are represented using a state of the art Bag of Words representation . This work extends the idea of detecting facial expressions through concept frames to concept segments and argues through extensive experiments that algorithms such as MIL are needed to reap the benefits of such representation . The key advantages of our approach are joint detection and localization of painful frames using only sequence level ground truth incorporation of temporal dynamics by representing the data not as individual frames but as segments and extraction of multiple segments which is well suited to signals with uncertain temporal location and duration in the video . Extensive experiments on UNBC McMaster Shoulder Pain dataset highlight the effectiveness of the approach by achieving competitive results on both tasks of pain classification and localization in videos . We also empirically evaluate the contributions of different components of MS MIL .

Methods We constructed a simple model for recording EEG comprising three components ERPs approximated via a trend model background waves constructed via an autoregressive model and noise . We evaluated the performance of the particle filter based on mean squared error P300 peak amplitude and latency . We then compared our filter with the Kalman filter and a conventional simple averaging method . To confirm the efficacy of the filter we used it to estimate ERP elicited by a P300 BCI speller . Results A 400 particle filter produced the best MSE . We found that the merit of the filter increased when the original waveform already had a low signal to noise ratio . We calculated the amount of averaging necessary after applying a particle filter that produced a result equivalent to that associated with conventional averaging and determined that the particle filter yielded a maximum 42.8 reduction in measurement time . The particle filter performed better than both the Kalman filter and conventional averaging for a low SNR in terms of both MSE and P300 peak amplitude and latency . For EEG data produced by the P300 speller we were able to use our filter to obtain ERP waveforms that were stable compared with averages produced by a conventional averaging method irrespective of the amount of averaging .

This is a realistic configuration usually encountered in surveillance systems in which each zooming camera is physically attached to a static structure . In particular a linear yet effective method to recover the affine structure of the observed scene from two or more such stationary zooming cameras is presented . The proposed method solely relies on point correspondences across images and no knowledge about the scene is required . Our method exploits the mostly translational displacement of the so called principal plane of each zooming camera to estimate the location of the plane at infinity . The principal plane of a camera at any given setting of its zoom is encoded in its corresponding perspective projection matrix from which it can be easily extracted . As a displacement of the principal plane of a camera under the effect of zooming allows the identification of a pair of parallel planes each zooming camera can be used to locate a line on the plane at infinity . Hence two or more such zooming cameras in general positions allow the obtainment of an estimate of the plane at infinity making it possible under the assumption of zero skew and or known aspect ratio to linearly calculate the camera s parameters . Finally the parameters of the camera and the coordinates of the plane at infinity are refined through a nonlinear least squares optimization procedure .

Methods This paper deals with quantitative prosodic analysis of neutral stress modified and rhymed speech in patients with PD . The analysis of prosody is based on quantification of monopitch monoloudness and speech rate abnormalities . Experimental dataset consists of 98 patients with PD and 51 healthy speakers . For the purpose of HD identification sequential floating feature selection algorithm and random forests classifier is used . In this paper we also introduce a concept of permutation test applied in the field of acoustic analysis of dysarthric speech . Results Prosodic features obtained from stress modified reading task provided higher classification accuracies compared to the ones extracted from reading task with neutral emotion demonstrating the importance of stress in speech prosody . Features calculated from poem recitation task outperformed both reading tasks in the case of gender undifferentiated analysis showing that rhythmical demands can in general lead to more precise identification of HD . Additionally some gender related patterns of dysprosody has been observed . Conclusions This paper confirms reduced variation of fundamental frequency in PD patients with HD . Interestingly increased variability of speech intensity compared to healthy speakers has been detected . Regarding speech rate disturbances our results does not report any particular pattern . We conclude further development of prosodic features quantifying the relationship between monopitch monoloudness and speech rate disruptions in HD can have a great potential in future PD analysis . \\n'],\n",

In this paper a novel method to detect eye blink artifacts from a single channel frontal EEG signal was proposed by combining digital filters with a rule based decision system and its performance was validated using an EEG dataset recorded from 24 healthy participants . The proposed method has two main advantages over the conventional methods . First it uses single channel EEG data without the need for electrooculogram references . Therefore this method could be particularly useful in brain computer interface applications using headband type wearable EEG devices with a few frontal EEG channels . Second this method could estimate the ranges of eye blink artifacts accurately . Our experimental results demonstrated that the artifact range estimated using our method was more accurate than that from the conventional methods and thus the overall accuracy of detecting epochs contaminated by eye blink artifacts was markedly increased as compared to conventional methods .

              " [' We introduce a new computational phonetic modeling framework for sign language recognition . This is based on dynamic static statistical subunits and provides sequentiality in an unsupervised manner without prior linguistic information . Subunit sequentiality refers to the decomposition of signs into two types of parts varying and non varying that are sequentially stacked across time . Our approach is inspired by the Movement Hold SL linguistic model that refers to such sequences . First we segment signs into intra sign primitives and classify each segment as dynamic or static i.e . movements and non movements . These segments are then clustered appropriately to construct a set of dynamic and static subunits . The dynamic static discrimination allows us employing different visual features for clustering the dynamic or static segments . Sequences of the generated subunits are used as sign pronunciations in a data driven lexicon . Based on this lexicon and the corresponding segmentation each subunit is statistically represented and trained on multimodal sign data as a hidden Markov model . In the proposed approach dynamic static sequentiality is incorporated in an unsupervised manner . Further handshape information is integrated in a parallel hidden Markov modeling scheme . The novel sign language modeling scheme is evaluated in recognition experiments on data from three corpora and two sign languages Boston University American SL which is employed pre segmented at the sign level Greek SL Lemmas and American SL Large Vocabulary Dictionary including both signer dependent and unseen signers testing .

Mesenchymal Stem Cells have the potential to differentiate into many cell phenotypes such as tissue or organ specific cells to perform special functions . Experimental observations illustrate that differentiation and proliferation of these cells can be regulated according to internal forces induced within their Extracellular Matrix . The process of how exactly they interpret and transduce these signals is not well understood . Methods A previously developed three dimensional computational model is here extended and employed to study how force free substrates and force induced substrate control cell differentiation and or proliferation during the mechanosensing process . Consistent with experimental observations it is assumed that cell internal deformation in correlation with the cell maturation state directly triggers cell differentiation and or proliferation . The Extracellular Matrix is modeled as Neo Hookean hyperelastic material assuming that cells are cultured within 3D nonlinear hydrogels . Results In agreement with well known experimental observations the findings here indicate that within neurogenic chondrogenic and osteogenic substrates Mesenchymal Stem Cells differentiation and proliferation can be precipitated by inducing the substrate with an internal force . Therefore cells require a longer time to grow and maturate within force free substrates than within force induced substrates . In the instance of Mesenchymal Stem Cells differentiation into a compatible phenotype the magnitude of the net traction force increases within chondrogenic and osteogenic substrates while it reduces within neurogenic substrates . This is consistent with experimental studies and numerical works recently published by the same authors . However in all cases the magnitude of the net traction force considerably increases at the instant of cell proliferation because of cell cell interaction . Conclusions The present model provides new perspectives to delineate the role of force induced substrates in remotely controlling the cell fate during cell matrix interaction which open the door for new tissue regeneration methodologies . \\n'],\n",

This paper presents an innovative method of converting average residential density into a set of one hectare 3D tiles to represent the dwelling stock . These generic tiles include residential land as well as the dwelling characteristics . The method was based on a detailed analysis of the English House Condition Survey data and density was calculated as the inverse of the plot area per dwelling . This found that when disaggregated by age band urban morphology and area type the frequency distribution of plot density per dwelling type can be represented by the gamma distribution . The shape parameter revealed interesting characteristics about the dwelling stock and how this has changed over time . It showed a consistent trend that older dwellings have greater variability in plot density than newer dwellings and also that apartments and detached dwellings have greater variability in plot density than terraced and semi detached dwellings . Once calibrated the shape parameter of the gamma distribution was used to convert the average density per housing type into a frequency distribution of plot density . These were then approximated by systematically selecting a set of generic tiles . These tiles are particularly useful as a medium for multidisciplinary research on decentralized environmental technologies or climate adaptation which requires this understanding of the variability of dwellings occupancies and urban space . It thereby links the socioeconomic modeling of city regions with the physical modeling of dwellings and associated infrastructure across the spatial scales . The tiles method has been validated by comparing results against English regional housing survey data and dwelling footprint area data . The next step would be to explore the possibility of generating generic residential area types and adapt the method to other countries that have similar housing survey data . \\n'],\n",

In this paper we show that it is possible to handle this problem without any priors by utilizing the visual and contextual information already available in such scenes. We propose a novel tracking method tailored to dense crowds which provides an alternative and complementary approach to methods that require modeling of crowd flow and simultaneously is less likely to fail in the case of dynamic crowd flows and anomalies by minimally relying on previous frames. Our method begins with the automatic identification of prominent individuals from the crowd that are easy to track. Then we use Neighborhood Motion Concurrence to model the behavior of individuals in a dense crowd this predicts the position of an individual based on the motion of its neighbors. When the individual moves with the crowd flow we use Neighborhood Motion Concurrence to predict motion while leveraging five frame instantaneous flow in case of dynamically changing flow and anomalies. All these aspects are then embedded in a framework which imposes hierarchy on the order in which positions of individuals are updated. Experiments on a number of sequences show that the proposed solution can track individuals in dense crowds without requiring any pre processing making it a suitable online tracking algorithm for dense crowds. \\n'],\n",

One of the main challenges is accurate vehicle matching across the cameras. Even if the cameras have similar views on vehicles vehicle matching remains a difficult task due to changes of their appearance between observations and inaccurate detections and occlusions which often occur in real scenarios. To be executed on smart cameras the matching has also to be efficient in terms of needed data and computations. To address these challenges we present a low complexity method for vehicle matching robust against appearance changes and inaccuracies in vehicle detection. We efficiently represent vehicle appearances using signature vectors composed of Radon transform like projections of the vehicle images and compare them in a coarse to fine fashion using a simple combination of 1 D correlations. To deal with appearance changes we include multiple observations in each vehicle appearance model. These observations are automatically collected along the vehicle trajectory. The proposed signature vectors can be calculated in low complexity smart cameras by a simple scan line algorithm of the camera software itself and transmitted to the other smart cameras or to the central server. Extensive experiments based on real traffic surveillance videos recorded in a tunnel validate our approach. \\n'],\n",

So the purpose of this study is to analyze the load distribution through the wrist joint with an arthrodesis treatment and compare the results with a normal wrist . Method To this end the rigid body spring model method was used on a three dimensional model of the wrist joint . The cartilage and ligaments were simulated as springs acting under compression and tension respectively while the bones were considered as rigid bodies . To simulate the arthrodesis the fused bones were considered as a single rigid body . Results The changes on the load distribution for each arthrodesis agree with the treatment objective reducing load transmission through a specific articular surface . For example for SLAC SNAC II most of the treatments reduced the load transmitted through the radioscaphoid fossae almost by 8 . However the capitolunate arthrodesis was the treatment that managed to keep the load transmitted through the radiolunate joint closer to normal conditions . Also in treatments where the scaphoid was excised the joint surface between the lunate surface compensates by doubling the transmitted force to the radius . Conclusions The common arthrodesis for treating SLAC SNAC II III reduces in fact the load on the radioscaphoid joint . Alternative treatments that reduce load distribution on the radiocarpal joint should be three corner and capitolunate arthrodesis for treating SLAC SNAC II and for SLAC SNAC III four corners with scaphoid excision .

              " ['In this paper we tackle the problem of gait recognition based on the model free approach. Numerous methods exist they all lead to high dimensional feature spaces. To address the problem of high dimensional feature space we propose the use of the Random Forest algorithm to rank features importance. In order to efficiently search throughout subspaces we apply a backward feature elimination search strategy. Our first experiments are carried out on unknown covariate conditions. Our first results suggest that the selected features contribute to increase the CCR of different existing classification methods. Secondary experiments are performed on unknown covariate conditions and viewpoints. Inspired by the location of our first experiments features we proposed a simple mask. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mask gives satisfactory results for all angles of the probe and consequently is not view specific. We also show that our mask performs well when an uncooperative experimental setup is considered as compared to the state of the art methods. As a consequence we propose a panoramic gait recognition framework on unknown covariate conditions. Our results suggest that panoramic gait recognition can be performed under unknown covariate conditions. Our approach can greatly reduce the complexity of the classification problem while achieving fair correct classification rates when gait is captured with unknown conditions. \\n'],\n",

However the depth maps captured by such sensors contain numerous invalid regions and suffer from heavy noise. These defects more or less influence the use of depth information in practical applications. In order to enhance the depth maps this paper proposes a new inpainting approach based on the fast marching method FMM . We extend the inpainting model and the propagation strategy of FMM to incorporate color information for depth inpainting. An edge preserving guided filter is further applied for noise reduction. To validate our algorithm we perform experiments on both Kinect data and Middlebury dataset which respectively provide qualitative and quantitative results. Meanwhile we also compare it to the original FMM and other two state of the art depth enhancement methods. Experimental results show that our method performs better than the local methods in terms of both visual and metric qualities and it achieves visually comparable results to the time consuming global method. \\n'],\n",

To handle this difficult problem in this paper we propose a novel method that performs accurate gaze estimation without restricting the user s head motion. The key idea is to decompose the original free head motion problem into subproblems including an initial fixed head pose problem and subsequent compensations to correct the initial estimation biases. For the initial estimation automatic image rectification and joint alignment with gaze estimation are introduced. Then compensations are done by either learning based regression or geometric based calculation. The merit of using such a compensation strategy is that the training requirement to allow head motion is not significantly increased only capturing a 5 s video clip is required. Experiments are conducted and the results show that our method achieves an average accuracy of around 3 by using only a single camera. \\n'],\n",

The framework is illustrated with a hedonic pricing analysis of urban land values and a net present value assessment for agricultural production system in combination with statistics based assessments of land suitability for other sectors . The results show that limited difference exists between the most commonly applied inductive approaches that use either multinomial or binomial logistic regression specifications of suitability . Land use simulations following the binomial regression based suitability values that were rescaled to bid prices perform better for all individual land use types .

The six substances considered although have similar optical properties their complex insertion loss at the THz part of the spectrum is significantly different because of differences in both their frequency dependent THz extinction coefficient as well as differences in their refractive index and scattering properties . As scattering can be unquantifiable in many spectroscopic experiments classification solely on differences in complex insertion loss can be inconclusive . The problem is addressed using two dimensional cross correlations between background and sample interferograms these ensure good noise suppression of the datasets and provide a range of statistical features that are subsequently used as inputs to the above classifiers . A cross validation procedure is adopted to assess the performance of the classifiers . Firstly the measurements related to samples that had thicknesses of 2mm were classified then samples at thicknesses of 4mm and after that 3mm were classified and the success rate and consistency of each classifier was recorded . In addition mixtures having thicknesses of 2 and 4mm as well as mixtures of 2 3 and 4mm were presented simultaneously to all classifiers . This approach provided further cross validation of the classification consistency of each algorithm . The results confirm the superiority in classification accuracy and robustness of the MLR and KNN algorithms which consistently outperformed the SVM and NB classifiers for the same number of feature vectors across all studies . The work establishes a general methodology for assessing the performance of other hyperspectral dataset classifiers on the basis of 2 D cross correlations in far infrared spectroscopy or other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum . It also advances the wider proliferation of automated THz imaging systems across new application areas e.g . biomedical imaging industrial processing and quality control where interpretation of hyperspectral images is still under development . \\n'],\n",

In this paper we address a novel boosting algorithm called AdaBoost that can improve the classification performance of AdaBoost with Universum data. AdaBoost chooses a function by minimizing the loss for labeled data and Universum data. The cost function is minimized by a greedy stagewise functional gradient procedure. Each training stage of AdaBoost is fast and efficient. The standard AdaBoost weights labeled samples during training iterations while AdaBoost gives an explicit weighting scheme for Universum samples as well. In addition this paper describes the practical conditions for the effectiveness of Universum learning. These conditions are based on the analysis of the distribution of ensemble predictions over training samples. Experiments on handwritten digits classification and gender classification problems are presented. As exhibited by our experimental results the proposed method can obtain superior performances over the standard AdaBoost by selecting proper Universum data. \\n'],\n",

To this end three FrOr models were compared with traditional parameters and an integer order model . We investigated which model would best fit the data the correlation with traditional lung function tests and the contribution to the diagnostic of airway obstruction . The data consisted of forced oscillation measurements obtained from healthy and asthmatic volunteers with mild moderate and severe obstructions . The first part of this study showed that a FrOr was the model that best fit the data . The correlation analysis resulted in reasonable to very good associations between FrOr parameters and spirometry . The closest associations were observed between parameters related to peripheral airway obstruction showing a clear relationship between the FrOr models and lung mechanics . Receiver operator analysis showed that FrOr parameters presented a high potential to contribute to the detection of the mild obstruction in a clinical setting . The accuracy observed in these parameters was higher than that observed in traditional FO parameters and that obtained from the InOr model . Patients with moderate and severe obstruction were identified with high accuracy . In conclusion the results obtained are in close agreement with asthma pathology and provide evidence that FO measurement associated with FrOr models is a non invasive simple and radiation free method for the detection of biomechanical abnormalities in asthma . \\n'],\n",

Visual features scattered on the elastic graph are assigned corresponding weights according to their relative ability to discriminate between gestures. The weights values are determined using adaptive boosting. A dictionary representing the variability of each gesture class is expressed in the form of a bunch graph. The positions of the nodes in the bunch graph are determined using three techniques manually semi automatically and automatically. Experimental results also show that the semi automatic annotation method is efficient and accurate in terms of three performance measures assignment cost accuracy and transformation error. In terms of the recognition accuracy our results show that the hierarchical weighting on features has more significant discriminative power than the classic method uniform weighting . The hierarchical elastic graph matching WEGM approach was used to classify a lexicon of ten hand postures and it was found that the poses were recognized with a recognition accuracy of 97.08 on average. Using the weighted scheme computing cycles can be decreased by only computing the features for those nodes whose weight is relatively high and ignoring the remaining nodes. It was found that only 30 of the nodes need to be computed to obtain a recognition accuracy of over 90 . \\n'],\n",

Therefore a multiphase successive active contour model based on the multivariable Gaussian distribution is presented to describe each phase . As geodesic active contour has a stronger ability in capturing boundary .

Popular fitting techniques such as those based on statistical models of shape and appearance require a training stage based on a set of facial images and their corresponding facial landmarks which have to be manually labeled . Therefore new images in which to fit the model can not differ too much in shape and appearance from those used for training .

In particular mobile platform localization and guidance in urban environments can be enabled with accurate models of the various building facades in a scene. Toward that end we present a system for detection segmentation and parameter estimation of building facades in stereo imagery.

These two models are incorporated into a two layer Markov Random Field MRF an appearance and disparity based discriminative classifier at the mid level and a geometric model to segment the building pixels into facades at the high level. By using object specific stereo features our discriminative classifier is able to achieve substantially higher accuracy than standard boosting or modeling with only appearance based features.

It is also robust to spatial and temporal scale changes as well as some deformations. The hierarchical algorithm codes a video as a compact set of spatio temporal volumes while considering their spatio temporal compositions in order to account for spatial and temporal contextual information. This hierarchy is achieved by first constructing a codebook of spatio temporal video volumes. Then a large contextual volume containing many spatio temporal volumes ensemble of volumes is considered. These ensembles are used to construct a probabilistic model of video volumes and their spatio temporal compositions. The algorithm was applied to three available video datasets for action recognition with different complexities KTH Weizmann and MSR II and the results were superior to other approaches especially in the case of a single training example and cross dataset1 action recognition. \\n'],\n",

When symptom severity was high participants made fewer affiliative facial expressions AUs 12 and 15 and more non affiliative facial expressions AU 14 . Participants also exhibited diminished head motion i.e. amplitude and velocity when symptom severity was high.

During the refining phase the flow field is decomposed in a set of clusters and based on descriptive motion properties. These properties are used in the collecting stage by a hierarchical or density based scheme to merge the set of clusters that represent different motion models. In addition a model selection method is introduced. This novel method analyzes the flow field and estimates the number of distinct moving objects using a Bayesian formulation. The research evaluates the performance achieved by the methods in a realistic surveillance situation. The experiments conducted proved that the proposed methods extract reliable motion information in real time and without using specialized computers. Moreover the resulting segmentation is less computationally demanding compared to other recent methods and therefore they are suitable for most of the robotic or surveillance applications. \\n'],\n",
              " [' Background Structural changes of the brain s third ventricle have been acknowledged as an indicative measure of the brain atrophy progression in neurodegenerative and endocrinal diseases . To investigate the ventricular enlargement in relation to the atrophy of the surrounding structures shape analysis is a promising approach . However there are hurdles in modeling the third ventricle shape . First it has topological variations across individuals due to the inter thalamic adhesion . In addition as an interhemispheric structure it needs to be aligned to the midsagittal plane to assess its asymmetric and regional deformation . Method To address these issues we propose a model based shape assessment . Our template model of the third ventricle consists of a midplane and a symmetric mesh of generic shape . By mapping the template s midplane to the individuals brain midsagittal plane we align the symmetric mesh on the midline of the brain before quantifying the third ventricle shape . To build the vertex wise correspondence between the individual third ventricle and the template mesh we employ a minimal distortion surface deformation framework . In addition to account for topological variations we implement geometric constraints guiding the template mesh to have zero width where the inter thalamic adhesion passes through preventing vertices crossing between left and right walls of the third ventricle . The individual shapes are compared using a vertex wise deformity from the symmetric template . Results Experiments on imaging and demographic data from a study of aging showed that our model was sensitive in assessing morphological differences between individuals in relation to brain volume gender and the fluid intelligence at age 72 . It also revealed that the proposed method can detect the regional and asymmetrical deformation unlike the conventional measures volume and width of the third ventricle . Similarity measures between binary masks and the shape model showed that the latter reconstructed shape details with high accuracy . Conclusions We have demonstrated that our approach is suitable to morphometrical analyses of the third ventricle providing high accuracy and inter subject consistency in the shape quantification . This shape modeling method with geometric constraints based on anatomical landmarks could be extended to other brain structures which require a consistent measurement basis in the morphometry . \\n'],\n",
              " [' A major difficulty with chest radiographic analysis is the invisibility of abnormalities caused by the superimposition of normal anatomical structures such as ribs over the main tissue to be examined . Suppressing the ribs with no information loss about the original tissue would therefore be helpful during manual identification or computer aided detection of nodules on a chest radiographic image . In this study we introduce a two step algorithm for eliminating rib shadows in chest radiographic images . The algorithm first delineates the ribs using a novel hybrid self template approach and then suppresses these delineated ribs using an unsupervised regression model that takes into account the change in proximal thickness of bone in the vertical axis . The performance of the system is evaluated using a benchmark set of real chest radiographic images . The experimental results determine that proposed method for rib delineation can provide higher accuracy than existing methods . The knowledge of rib delineation can remarkably improve the nodule detection performance of a current computer aided diagnosis system . It is also shown that the rib suppression algorithm can increase the nodule visibility by eliminating rib shadows while mostly preserving the nodule intensity . \\n'],\n",

Our objective is to assess the coherence of topics and their ability to represent the contents of clinical reports from a primary care physician s point of view . Methods Three latent Dirichlet allocation models were fit to a large collection of clinical reports . Topics were manually evaluated by primary care physicians and graduate students . Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests for Paired Samples were used to evaluate differences between different topic models while differences in performance between students and primary care physicians were tested using Mann Whitney U tests for each of the tasks .

In this study CFD owing its capability of predicting detailed flow field was adopted to model the blood flow in images based patient specific LV over cardiac cycle . In most published studies the blood is modeled as Newtonian that is not entirely accurate as the blood viscosity varies with the shear rate in non linear manner . In this paper we studied the effect of Newtonian assumption on the degree of accuracy of intraventricular hemodynamics . In doing so various non Newtonian models and Newtonian model are used in the analysis of the intraventricular flow and the viscosity of the blood . Initially we used the cardiac MRI images to reconstruct the time resolved geometry of the patient specific LV . After the unstructured mesh generation the simulations were conducted in the CFD commercial solver FLUENT to analyze the intraventricular hemodynamic parameters . The findings indicate that the Newtonian assumption can not adequately simulate the flow dynamic within the LV over the cardiac cycle which can be attributed to the pulsatile and recirculation nature of the flow and the low blood shear rate . \\n'],\n",

Subsequently three dimensional spatiotemporal volumes are built by combining the candidate blocks in the current key frame with the corresponding blocks in previous frames .

              " ['Text contained in scene images provides the semantic context of the images. For that reason robust extraction of text regions is essential for successful scene text understanding. However separating text pixels from scene images still remains as a challenging issue because of uncontrolled lighting conditions and complex backgrounds. In this paper we propose a two stage conditional random field TCRF approach to robustly extract text regions from the scene images. The proposed approach models the spatial and hierarchical structures of the scene text and it finds text regions based on the scene text model. In the first stage the system generates multiple character proposals for the given image by using multiple image segmentations and a local CRF model. In the second stage the system selectively integrates the generated character proposals to determine proper character regions by using a holistic CRF model. Through the TCRF approach we cast the scene text separation problem as a probabilistic labeling problem which yields the optimal label configuration of pixels that maximizes the conditional probability of the given image. Experimental results indicate that our framework exhibits good performance in the case of the public databases. \\n'],\n",

              " [' We present a new method for multi agent activity analysis and recognition that uses low level motion features and exploits the inherent structure and recurrence of motion present in multi agent activity scenarios. Our representation is inspired by the need to circumvent the difficult problem of tracking in multi agent scenarios and the observation that for many visual multi agent recognition tasks the spatiotemporal description of events irrespective of agent identity is sufficient for activity classification. We begin by learning generative models describing motion induced by individual actors or groups which are considered to be agents. These models are Gaussian mixture distributions learned by linking clusters of optical flow to obtain contiguous regions of locally coherent motion. These possibly overlapping regions or segments known as motion patterns are then used to analyze a scene by estimating their spatial and temporal relationships. The geometric transformations between two patterns are obtained by iteratively warping one pattern onto another whereas the temporal relationships are obtained from their relative times of occurrence within videos. These motion segments and their spatio temporal relationships are represented as a graph where the nodes are the statistical distributions and the edges have geometric transformations between motion patterns transformed to Lie space as their attributes. Two activity instances are then compared by estimating the cost of attributed inexact graph matching. We demonstrate the application of our framework in the analysis of American football plays a typical multi agent activity. The performance analysis of our method shows that it is feasible and easily generalizable. \\n'],\n",

The first type provides gradient structure constraints that favor flow consistency across strong image gradients. The second type imposes perceptual color constraints that reinforce relationship among pixels in a window according to their color statistics. The third type yields occlusion constraints that reject pixels that are seen in one window but not seen in the other.

However most state of the art cross domain classification methods treat documents as plain text and ignore the hyperlink relationship existing among the documents . In this paper we propose a novel cross domain document classification approach called Link Bridged Topic model . LBT consists of two key steps . Firstly LBT utilizes an auxiliary link network to discover the direct or indirect co citation relationship among documents by embedding the background knowledge into a graph kernel . The mined co citation relationship is leveraged to bridge the gap across different domains . Secondly LBT simultaneously combines the content information and link structures into a unified latent topic model . The model is based on an assumption that the documents of source and target domains share some common topics from the point of view of both content information and link structure . By mapping both domains data into the latent topic spaces LBT encodes the knowledge about domain commonality and difference as the shared topics with associated differential probabilities . The learned latent topics must be consistent with the source and target data as well as content and link statistics . Then the shared topics act as the bridge to facilitate knowledge transfer from the source to the target domains . Experiments on different types of datasets show that our algorithm significantly improves the generalization performance of cross domain document classification . \\n'],\n",
              " ['Background modeling is widely used in visual surveillance systems aiming to facilitate analysis of real world video scenes. The goal is to discriminate between pixels from foreground objects and those ones from the background. However real world scenarios tend to have time and spatial non stationary variations being difficult to reveal the foreground and background entities from video data. Here we propose a novel adaptive background modeling termed Object based Selective Updating with Correntropy OSUC to support video based surveillance systems. Our approach that is developed within an adaptive learning framework unveils existing spatio temporal pixel relationships making use of a single Gaussian for the model representation stage. Moreover we introduce a background updating scheme composed of an updating rule that is based on the stochastic gradient algorithm and Correntropy cost function. As a result this scheme can extract the temporal statistical pixel distribution at the same time dealing with non stationary pixel value fluctuations that affect the background model. Here an automatic tuning strategy of the cost function bandwidth parameter is carried out that can handle both Gaussian and non Gaussian noise environments. Besides to include pixel spatial relationships in the background modeling processing we introduce an object based selective learning rate strategy for enhancing the background modeling accuracy. Particularly an object motion analysis stage is presented to detect and track foreground entities based on pixel intensities and motion direction attained via optical flow computation. Testing is provided on well known datasets for discriminating between foreground and background that include stationary and non stationary behaviors. Achieved results show that the OSUC outperforms in most of the considered cases the state of the art approaches with an affordable computational cost. Therefore the proposed approach is suitable for supporting real world video based surveillance systems. \\n'],\n",

In this paper we present a motion segmentation method attempting to address some of the major issues in the area. Namely we propose an efficient framework where more complex motion models can be seamlessly integrated both maintaining computational tractability and not penalizing non translational motion. Moreover we expose in depth the problem of object leakage due to occlusion and highlight that motion segmentation could be treated as a graph coloring problem. Our algorithm uses an approach based on graph theory and resolves occlusion cases in a robust manner. To endow our method with scalability we follow the previously presented subsequence architecture and test it in a streaming setup. Extensive experiments demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of the method. The segmentation results are competitive compared to the state of the art. \\n'],\n",

The merits of phrasal concept query suggestions for this domain are their readability and retrieval effectiveness phrasal concepts are natural for academic authors because of their frequent use of terminology and subject specific phrases and academic papers describe their key ideas via these subject specific phrases and thus phrasal concepts can be used effectively to find those papers .

The trajectories capture the motion characteristics of different moving objects in space and temporal dimensions . In dense trajectories points are sampled at uniform intervals in space and time and then tracked using a dense optical flow field over a fixed length of L frames spread overlapping over the entire video . However among these base trajectories a few may continue for longer than duration L capturing motion characteristics of objects that may be more valuable than the information from the base trajectories . Thus we propose a technique that searches for trajectories with a longer duration and refer to these as ordered trajectories . Experimental results show that ordered trajectories perform much better than the base trajectories both standalone and when combined . Moreover the uniform sampling of dense trajectories does not discriminate objects of interest from the background or other objects . Consequently a lot of information is accumulated which actually may not be useful . This can especially escalate when there is more data due to an increase in the number of action classes . We observe that our proposed trajectories remove some background clutter too .

These panoramic videos are generated by stitching video frames captured from a panoramic video acquisition system typically comprising of multiple video cameras arranged on a static or mobile platform. A mobile panoramic video acquisition system may suffer from global mechanical vibrations as well as independent inter camera vibrations resulting in a jittery panoramic video. While existing stabilization schemes generally tackle single camera vibrations they do not account for these inter camera vibrations. In this paper we propose a video stabilization technique for multi camera panoramic videos under the consideration that independent jitter may be exhibited by content of each camera. The proposed method comprises of three steps the first step removes the global jitter in the video by estimating collective motion and subsequently removing the high frequency component from it. The second step removes the independent i.e. local jitter of each camera by estimating motion of each camera content separately. Pixels that are located in the overlapping regions of panoramic video are contributed by neighboring cameras therefore the estimated camera motion for these pixels is weighted using the blend masks generated by the stitching process. The final step applies local geometric warping to the stitched frames and removes any residual jitter induced due to parallax. Experimental results prove that proposed scheme performs better than existing panoramic stabilization schemes. \\n'],\n",

We studied a database made up of 49 European banks whose shares are included in the Dow Jones EURO STOXX TMI Banks Index . Regarding the factors for the implementation we considered three feasible reasons . Firstly WA adoption can be motivated by operational factors as WA can aid in increasing operational efficiency . Secondly we expect large banks to have higher WA levels as small firms face competitive disadvantages with regard to technology adoption . Lastly WA can also be understood as a part of the Corporate Social Responsibility strategy so the more committed a bank is to CSR the more prone it will be to implement WA . Our results indicate that neither the operational factors nor the firm size seem to have exerted a significant influence on WA adoption . Regarding CSR commitment results indicate a significant influence on WA adoption . However the effect of the influence is contrary to that hypothesized since more CSR committed banks have less accessible Web sites . A possible reason for this result is that banks not included in the CSR indexes try to overcome this drawback by engaging in alternative CSR activities such as WA . Nowadays Internet banking is a must have service for financial entities . Several authors conclude that it contributes to increase profitability and is a necessary investment to keep the custom of younger members . So Web sites are a key instrument for improving the competitive edge of banks as well as nonfinancial firms . Banks have an additional incentive to have a high quality Web site as Internet is a means of providing information to investors and other parties interacting with the bank . This factor is especially important in the case of banks whose shares are publicly traded . To assess the quality of a Web design many frameworks have been proposed by researchers . Ho proposed a framework that included criteria such as timeliness custom logistics and seasonal factors . Elliot Morup Petersen and Bjon Andersen also proposed a model which considers company information product service promotion transaction processing and customer service .

To address this issue this study proposes an ensemble of image feature representations including various local patch or block based representations a one dimensional vector image representation a two dimensional matrix image representation and a global matrix image representation . Notably some of these representations are designed to preserve the global facial geometry of the low resolution input while others are designed to preserve the local detailed texture . For each feature representation a regression function is constructed to synthesize a high resolution image from the low resolution input image . The synthesis process is conducted in a layer by layer fashion with the output from one layer serving as the input to the following layer . Importantly each regression function is associated with a classifier in order to determine which regression functions are required in the synthesis procedure in accordance with the particular characteristics of the input image . Furthermore these classifiers can also help to deal with the individual ambiguity of system low resolution inputs .

Recently a tree structure model for multi view face detection was proposed. This method is primarily designed for facial landmark detection and consequently a face detection is provided. However the effort to model inner facial structures by using a detailed facial landmark labelling resulted on a complex and suboptimal system for face detection. Instead we adopt CDPMs where the models are learned from partially labelled images using Latent Support Vector Machines LSVM . Furthermore LSVM is enhanced with data mining and bootstrapping procedures to enrich models during the training. Furthermore a post optimization procedure is derived to improve the performance. This semi supervised methodology allows us to build models based on weakly labelled data while incrementally learning latent positive and negative samples.

Many coding and pooling methods are proposed and how to apply them better in different conditions has become a practical problem . In this paper to better use BoW in different applications we study the relation between many typical coding methods and two popular pooling methods . Specifically complete combinations of coding and pooling are evaluated based on an extremely large range of vocabulary sizes on five primary and popular datasets . Three typical ones are 15 Scenes Caltech 101 and PASCAL VOC 2007 while the other two large scale ones are Caltech 256 and ImageNet . Based on the systematic evaluation some interesting conclusions are drawn . Some conclusions are the extensions of previous viewpoints while some are different but important to understand BoW model . Based on these conclusions we provide detailed application criterions by evaluating coding and pooling based on precision efficiency and memory requirements in different applications . We hope that this study can be helpful to evaluate different coding and pooling methods the conclusions can be beneficial to better understand BoW and the application criterions can be valuable to use BoW better in different applications . \\n'],\n",

Part based methods alternate the evaluation of local appearance models to produce a per point response map and a shape fitting step which finds a valid face shape that maximises the sum of the per point responses. Our approach focuses on obtaining better appearance models for the creation of the response maps and it can be used in combination with any shape fitting strategy. Local appearance models need to tackle very heterogeneous data when dealing with in the wild imagery due to factors as varying head poses facial expressions identity lighting conditions or image quality among others. Pose wise experts are typically used in this scenario so that each expert deals with more homogeneous data. However the computation cost at test time is significantly increased. Furthermore choosing the right expert is not straightforward which can lead to gross errors. We propose to dynamically select at test time the training examples used for inference. We use a global similarity measure to select the most adequate training examples for inference and create a single test sample specific expert using a localised inference technique. To illustrate the validity of these ideas we capitalise on the recently proposed use of regression to generate local appearance models. In particular we use Gaussian processes as their non parametric nature easily allows for localised regression. This novel way of constructing the response maps is combined with two state of the art standard shape fitting algorithms the popular Constrained Local Models framework and the Consensus of Exemplars method. We validate our method on two publicly available datasets as well as on a cross dataset experiment showing a considerable performance improvement of the proposed approach. \\n'],\n",

In PMD sensors each pixel samples the correlation between emitted and received light signals.

With motion PMD pixels capture different depths at each stage. As a result correlation samples are not coherent with a single depth producing artifacts. We propose to detect and remove motion artifacts from a single frame taken by a PMD camera. The algorithm we propose is very fast simple and can be easily included in camera hardware. We recover depth of each pixel by exploiting consistency of the correlation samples and local neighbors of the pixel.

Most approaches for shadow detection are still typically restricted to penumbra shadows and cannot cope well with umbra shadows. Consequently umbra shadow regions are usually detected as part of moving objects thus affecting the performance of the final detection. In this paper we address the detection of both penumbra and umbra shadow regions. First a novel bottom up approach is presented based on gradient and colour models which successfully discriminates between chromatic moving cast shadow regions and those regions detected as moving objects. In essence those regions corresponding to potential shadows are detected based on edge partitioning and colour statistics. Subsequently i temporal similarities between textures and ii spatial similarities between chrominance angle and brightness distortions are analysed for each potential shadow region for detecting the umbra shadow regions. Our second contribution refines even further the segmentation results a tracking based top down approach increases the performance of our bottom up chromatic shadow detection algorithm by properly correcting non detected shadows. To do so a combination of motion filters in a data association framework exploits the temporal consistency between objects and shadows to increase the shadow detection rate. Experimental results exceed current state of the art in shadow accuracy for multiple well known surveillance image databases which contain different shadowed materials and illumination conditions. \\n'],\n",

Secondly we apply scan line particle filtering using the corresponding landmarks as a virtual sensor data to estimate the best disparity value. Lastly we reduce the computational redundancy of particle filtering in our stereo correspondence with a Markov chain model given the previous scan line values.

Several sets of experiments demonstrate that our proposed method performs competitively with the classical scale invariant feature transform method for images with scale changes and performs better than the traditional MSER and Affine SIFT methods for images with affine distortions .

There is a large body of work on developing such theories as they have important applications in viral marketing recommendations as well as information retrieval . Influence theories are typically evaluated through a manual process that can not scale to data voluminous enough to draw safe representative conclusions . To overcome this issue we introduce in this paper a formalized framework for large scale automatic evaluation of topic specific influence theories that are specialized in Twitter . Basically it consists of five conjunctive conditions that are indicative of real influence exertion the first three determine which influence theories are compatible with our framework while the other two estimate their relative effectiveness . At the core of these two conditions lies a novel metric that assesses the aggregate sentiment of a group of users and allows for estimating how close the behavior of influencers is to that of the entire community . We put our framework into practice using a large scale test bed with real data from 75 Twitter communities . In order to select the theories that can be employed in our analysis we introduce a generic two dimensional taxonomy that elucidates their functionality . With its help we ended up with five established topic specific theories that are applicable to our settings . The outcomes of our analysis reveal significant differences in their performance . To explain them we introduce a novel methodology for delving into the internal dynamics of the groups of influencers they define . We use it to analyze the implications of the selected theories and based on the resulting evidence we propose a novel partition of influence theories in three major categories with divergent performance . \\n'],\n",

The most existing contour based approaches relevant to object detection address this problem by normalizing descriptor or multi scale searching such as sliding window searching spatial pyramid model etc . Besides Hough voting framework can predict the scale of an object according to some meaning fragments . However utilizing scale variant descriptor or complicated structure in these measures reduces the efficiency of detection . In the present paper we propose a novel shape feature called scale invariant contour segment context . This feature is based on the angle between contour line segments . It remains unchanged as scale varies . Most importantly it evaluates the scale of objects located in cluttered images and facilitates localization of the boundary of the object in unseen images simultaneously . In this way we need to focus on just the shape matching algorithm without considering the variant scale of the object in an image . This is a procedure which absolutely differs from voting and sliding window searching . We do experiments on ETHZ shape dataset Weizmann horses dataset and the bottle subset from PASCAL datasets . The results confirm that the present model of object detection based on CSC outperforms state of the art of shape based detection methods . \\n'],\n",

The 3D space is sampled by a set of virtual cut planes that intersect the baseline of the stereo rig and implicitly define possible pixel correspondences across views . The likelihood of these correspondences being true matches is measured using signal symmetry analysis which enables to obtain profile contours of the 3D scene that become lines whenever the virtual cut planes intersect planar surfaces . The detection and estimation of these lines cuts is formulated as a global optimization problem over the symmetry matching cost and pairs of reconstructed lines are used to generate plane hypotheses that serve as input to PEARL clustering . The PEARL algorithm alternates between a discrete optimization step which merges planar surface hypotheses and discards detections with poor support and a continuous optimization step which refines the plane poses taking into account surface slant . The pipeline outputs an accurate semi dense Piecewise Planar Reconstruction of the 3D scene . In addition the input images can be segmented into piecewise planar regions using a standard labeling formulation for assigning pixels to plane detections .

However the conventional two prevailing pooling techniques namely average and max poolings are not theoretically optimal due to the unrecoverable loss of the spatial information during the statistical summarization and the underlying over simplified assumption about the feature distribution . Addressing these issues this paper proposes to generalize previous pooling methods toward a weighted norm spatial pooling function tailored for class specific feature spatial distribution . Optimizing such a pooling function toward discriminative class separability that is subject to a spatial smoothness constraint yields a so called geometric norm pooling method . Furthermore to handle the variation of object scale position which would affect not only the learning of discriminative pooling weights but also the applicability of the learned weights we propose a simple yet effective self alignment step during both learning and testing to adaptively adjust the pooling weights for individual images . Image segmentation and visual saliency map are utilized to construct a directed pixel adjacency graph . The discriminative pooling weights are diffused using random walk on the constructed graph and therefore the discriminative pooling weights are propagated onto the salient and foreground region . This leads to a robust version of GLP which can cope with the misalignment of object position and scale in images . Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed GLP feature pooling framework . The proposed random walk based self alignment step can effectively alleviate the image misalignment issue and further boost classification accuracy . State of the art image classification and action recognition performances are attained on several benchmarks . \\n'],\n",

Many sub problems have arisen in this new field that remain only partially understood. A comparison of the regression performance of different texture and geometric features and the investigation of the correlations between continuous dimensional axes and basic categorized emotions are two of these. This paper presents empirical studies addressing these problems and it reports results from an evaluation of different methods for detecting spontaneous facial expressions within the arousal valence AV dimensional space. The evaluation compares the performance of texture features SIFT Gabor LBP against geometric features FAP based distances and the fusion of the two. It also compares the prediction of arousal and valence obtained using the best fusion method to the corresponding ground truths. Spatial distribution shift similarity and correlation are considered for the six basic categorized emotions i.e. anger disgust fear happiness sadness surprise . Using the NVIE database results show that the fusion of LBP and FAP features performs the best. The results from the NVIE and FEEDTUM databases reveal novel findings about the correlations of arousal and valence dimensions to each of six basic emotion categories. \\n'],\n",

Most tracking algorithms are limited due to variations in object appearance from changes in illumination viewing angle object scale and object shape. This paper is motivated by the fact that tracking performance degradation is caused not only by changes in object appearance but also by the inflexible controls of tracker parameters. To the best of our knowledge optimization of tracker parameters has not been thoroughly investigated even though it critically influences tracking performance. The challenge is to equip an adaptive tracking algorithm with an optimization capability for a more flexible and robust appearance model. In this paper the Markov decision process which has been applied successfully in many dynamic systems is employed to optimize an adaptive appearance model based tracking algorithm. The adaptive visual tracking is formulated as a Markov decision process based dynamic parameter optimization problem with uncertain and incomplete information. The high computation requirements of the Markov decision process formulation are solved by the proposed prioritized Q learning approach.

Each SDM is subsequently rendered based on triplet angles of face poses . Before matching to SDM an initial estimate of triplet angles of face poses is obtained in the probe face image using an automatic head pose estimation approach . Then an array of the SDM is selected based on the estimated triplet angles for each subject . Finally the selected arrays from SDMs are compared with the probe image by sparse representation classification . Convincing results were acquired to handle pose changes on the FERET CMU PIE LFW and video face databases based on the proposed method compared to several state of the art in pose invariant face recognition . \\n'],\n",

Using tracked object trajectories we organize similar motion trajectories into clusters using the spectral clustering technique . This set of clusters depicts the different paths routes i.e . the distinct events taking place at various locations in the scene . A temporal mining algorithm is used to mine interval based frequent temporal patterns occurring in the scene . A temporal pattern indicates a set of events that are linked based on their relationship with other events in the set and we use Allen s interval based temporal logic to describe these relations . The resulting frequent patterns are used to generate temporal association rules which convey the semantic information contained in the scene .

In order to comprehensively represent the difference between different genders or ethnicities we propose a novel local descriptor namely local circular patterns . LCP improves the widely utilized local binary patterns and its variants by replacing the binary quantization with a clustering based one resulting in higher discriminative power as well as better robustness to noise . Meanwhile the following Adaboost based feature selection finds the most discriminative gender and race related features and assigns them with different weights to highlight their importance in classification which not only further raises the performance but reduces the time and memory cost as well .

A common approach to any multi objects tracking algorithm in a network of cameras comprises of two main steps . First the movement trajectory of each object within the field of view of a camera is extracted and is called object tracklet . Then the set of tracklets are used to determine the persistent trace of each object . In this paper we assume that the tracklets are extracted by a conventional tracking algorithm . The occurrence of occlusion between objects within the viewing scene leads to various types of errors on the extracted tracklets . If these erroneous tracklets are used in a multi object tracking algorithm and ignoring the correction phase then the errors are propagated and affect the results of tracking algorithm . Therefore the true tracklets have to be estimated from the erroneous tracklets . In this paper we propose a variational model for estimating the true tracklets . The variational principle proposed in this model is established by first introducing a variational energy function . Then the erroneous tracklets are used to estimate the true tracklets through optimizing the energy function .

To address this common problem this paper proposes a statistical adaptive metric learning SAML method by exploring various selections and combinations of multiple statistics in a unified metric learning framework. Most statistics have certain advantages in specific controlled environments and systematic selections and combinations can adapt them to more realistic in the wild scenarios. In the proposed method multiple statistics include means covariance matrices and Gaussian distributions are explicitly mapped or generated in the Riemannian manifolds. Typically d dimensional mean vectors in Rd are mapped to a Rd d space of symmetric positive definite SPD matrices . Subsequently by embedding the heterogeneous manifolds in their tangent Hilbert space subspace combination with minimal deviation is selected from multiple statistics. Then Mahalanobis metrics are introduced to map them back into the Euclidean space. Unified optimizations are finally performed based on the Euclidean distances. In the proposed method subspaces with smaller deviations are selected before metric learning. Therefore by exploring different metric combinations the final learning is more representative and effective than exhaustively learning from all the hybrid metrics. Experimental evaluations are conducted on human action recognitions in both static and dynamic scenarios. Promising results demonstrate that the proposed method performs effectively for human action recognitions in the wild. \\n'],\n",

This may be prohibitive in extremely large scale applications and applications on memory constrained devices such as tablets and smartphones . In this paper with the goal of reducing the memory requirements of keypoint descriptors such as SIFT without affecting their performance we propose BIG OH a simple yet extremely effective method for binary quantization of any descriptor based on gradient orientation histograms . BIG OH s memory requirements are very small when it uses SIFT s default parameters for the construction of the gradient orientation histograms it only requires 16bytes per descriptor . BIG OH quantizes gradient orientation histograms by computing a bit vector representing the relative magnitudes of local gradients associated with neighboring orientation bins .

In contrast to structured light the active stereo systems utilize the projected patterns only as auxiliary information in correspondence search whereas the structured light systems have to detect the patterns and decode them to compute depth . The concept of non recurring De Bruijn sequences is introduced and a few algorithms based on the non recurring De Bruijn sequence are designed to build optimized projection patterns for several stereo parameters . When only the search window size of a stereo system is given we show that a non recurring De Bruijn sequence with corresponding parameters makes the longest functional pattern and presents experimental results using real scenes to show the effectiveness of the proposed projection patterns . Additionally if the pattern length is given in the form of maximum disparity search range the algorithm using branch and bound search scheme to find an optimal sub sequence of a non recurring De Bruijn sequence is proposed . \\n'],\n",

Despite significant improvements in optical flow computations poor texture still remains a challenge to even the most accurate methods . Accordingly we explored the effects of simple modification of images rather than the algorithms . To localize and add texture to poorly textured regions in the background which induce the propagation of foreground optical flow we first perform a texture segmentation using Laws masks and generate a texture map . Next using a binary frame difference we constrain the poorly textured regions to those with negligible motion . Finally we calculate the optical flow for the modified images with added texture using the best optical flow methods available . It is shown that if the threshold used for binarizing the frame difference is in a specific range determined empirically variations in the final foreground detection will be insignificant . Employing the texture addition in conjunction with leading optical flow methods on multiple real and animation sequences with different texture distributions revealed considerable advantages including improvement in the accuracy of foreground boundary preservation prevention of object merging and reduction in the computation time . The F measure and the Boundary Displacement Error metrics were used to evaluate the similarity between detected and ground truth foreground masks . Furthermore preventing foreground optical flow propagation and reduction in the computation time are discussed using analysis of optical flow convergence . \\n'],\n",

To reduce these effects we propose an accurate ARO classification method using a hierarchical finite state machine that consists of pixel layer region layer and event layer FSMs where the result of the lower layer FSM is used as the input of the higher layer FSM . Each FSM is defined by a Mealy state machine with three states and several state transitions where a support vector machine determines the state transition based on the current state and input features such as area intensity motion shape time duration color and edge . Because it uses the hierarchical FSM structure with features that are optimally trained by SVM classifiers the proposed ARO classification method does not require threshold values and guarantees better classification accuracy under severe environmental changes . In experiments the proposed ARO classification method provided much higher classification accuracy and lower false alarm rate than the state of the art methods in both public databases and a commercial database . The proposed ARO classification method can be applied to many practical applications such as detection of littering illegal parking theft and camouflaged soldiers . \\n'],\n",

Time of Flight cameras have become a very promising alternative to stereo based range sensing systems as they provide depth measurements at a high frame rate . However there are actually two main drawbacks that restrict their use in a wide range of applications namely their fairly low spatial resolution as well as the amount of noise within the depth estimation . In order to address these drawbacks we propose a new approach based on sensor fusion . That is we couple a ToF camera of low resolution with a 2 D camera of higher resolution to which the low resolution depth map will be efficiently upsampled . In this paper we first review the existing depth map enhancement approaches based on sensor fusion and discuss their limitations . We then propose a unified multi lateral filter that accounts for the inaccuracy of depth edges position due to the low resolution ToF depth maps . By doing so unwanted artefacts such as texture copying and edge blurring are almost entirely eliminated . Moreover the proposed filter is configurable to behave as most of the alternative depth enhancement approaches . Using a convolution based formulation and data quantization and downsampling the described filter has been effectively and efficiently implemented for dynamic scenes in real time applications .

Our algorithm is based on the computation of the vanishing point of point trajectories thus integrating information for more than two consecutive frames. It can improve performance in the presence of erroneous correspondences and occlusions in the field of view of the camera. The algorithm has been tested with virtual sequences generated with Blender as well as some real sequences from both the public KITTI benchmark and a number of challenging video sequences also proposed in this paper. For comparison purposes some algorithms from the literature have also been implemented. The results show that the algorithm has proven to be very robust outperforming the compared algorithms specially in outdoor scenes where the lack of texture can make optical flow algorithms yield inaccurate results. Timing evaluation proves that the proposed algorithm can reach up to 15fps showing its suitability for real time applications. \\n'],\n",

In these systems some features descriptors objects or concepts are extracted in each level and therefore total computational complexity of such systems is huge . In this paper we present a new general framework to impose attention control on a video analysis system using Q learning . Thus our proposed framework restructures a given system dynamically to direct attention to the blocks extracting the most informative features concepts and reduces computational complexity of the system . In other words the proposed framework directs flow of processing actively using a learning attention control method . The proposed framework is evaluated for event detection in broadcast soccer videos using limited numbers of training samples . Experiments show that the proposed framework is able to learn how to direct attention to informative features concepts and restructure the initial structure of the system dynamically to reach the final goal with less computational complexity . \\n'],\n",

In particular we present an attention driven spatial pooling strategy and show that considering image features from the salient parts of images improves the results of the previous models . We also investigate different semantic properties of images by carrying out an analysis of a diverse set of recently proposed semantic features which encode meta level object categories scene attributes and invoked feelings .

However few works have studied the importance of time in queries such as Philip Seymour Hoffman where the results may require no recency at all . In this work we focus on this type of queries named time sensitive queries where the results are preferably from a diversified time span not necessarily the most recent one . Unlike related work we follow a content based approach to identify the most important time periods of the query and integrate time into a re ranking model to boost the retrieval of documents whose contents match the query time period . For that purpose we define a linear combination of topical and temporal scores which reflects the relevance of any web document both in the topical and temporal dimensions thus contributing to improve the effectiveness of the ranked results across different types of queries . Our approach relies on a novel temporal similarity measure that is capable of determining the most important dates for a query while filtering out the non relevant ones .

In this paper we investigate this issue known as overspecialization or serendipity problem by proposing a strategy that fosters the suggestion of surprisingly interesting items the user might not have otherwise discovered . The proposed strategy enriches a graph based recommendation algorithm with background knowledge that allows the system to deeply understand the items it deals with .

Several algorithms to perform transductive classification considering text collections represented in a vector space model have been proposed . However the use of these algorithms is unfeasible in practical applications due to the independence assumption among instances or terms and the drawbacks of these algorithms . Network based algorithms come up to avoid the drawbacks of the algorithms based on vector space model and to improve transductive classification . Networks are mostly used for label propagation in which some labeled objects propagate their labels to other objects through the network connections . Bipartite networks are useful to represent text collections as networks and perform label propagation . The generation of this type of network avoids requirements such as collections with hyperlinks or citations computation of similarities among all texts in the collection as well as the setup of a number of parameters . In a bipartite heterogeneous network objects correspond to documents and terms and the connections are given by the occurrences of terms in documents . The label propagation is performed from documents to terms and then from terms to documents iteratively . Nevertheless instead of using terms just as means of label propagation in this article we propose the use of the bipartite network structure to define the relevance scores of terms for classes through an optimization process and then propagate these relevance scores to define labels for unlabeled documents . The new document labels are used to redefine the relevance scores of terms which consequently redefine the labels of unlabeled documents in an iterative process . We demonstrated that the proposed approach surpasses the algorithms for transductive classification based on vector space model or networks . Moreover we demonstrated that the proposed algorithm effectively makes use of unlabeled documents to improve classification and it is faster than other transductive algorithms . \\n'],\n",

Thus the inappropriate handling of diacritics reduces the retrieval performance in search engines . A straightforward solution to this problem is to normalize tokens by replacing diacritic characters with their American Standard Code for Information Interchange counterparts . However this so called ASCIIfication produces either synthetic words that are not legitimate Turkish words or legitimate words with meanings that are completely different from those of the original words . These non valid synthetic words can not be processed by morphological analysis components which expect the input to be valid Turkish words . By contrast synthetic words are not a problem when no stemmer or a simple first n characters stemmer is used in the text analysis pipeline . This difference emphasizes the notion of the diacritic sensitivity of stemmers . In this study we propose and evaluate an alternative solution based on the application of deASCIIfication which restores accented letters in query terms or text documents . Our risk sensitive evaluation results showed that the diacritics restoration approach yielded more effective and robust results compared with normalizing tokens to remove diacritics . \\n'],\n",

Results The implemented framework achieved encouraging results in human activity recognition . We have implemented a new set of features extracted from wearable sensors that are ambitious from a computational point of view and able to ensure high classification results comparable with the state of the art wearable systems . A feature selection framework is developed in order to improve the clustering accuracy and reduce computational complexity . The software OpenSignals was used for signal acquisition and signal processing algorithms were developed in Python Programming Language and Orange Software . Several clustering methods such as K Means Affinity Propagation Mean Shift and Spectral Clustering were applied . The K means methodology presented promising accuracy results for person dependent and independent cases with 99.29 and 88.57 respectively . Conclusions The presented study performs two different tests in intra and inter subject context and a set of 180 features is implemented which are easily selected to classify different activities . The implemented algorithm does not stipulate a priori any value for time window or its overlap percentage of the signal but performs a search to find the best parameters that define the specific data . A clustering metric based on the construction of the data confusion matrix is also proposed . The main contribution of this work is the design of a novel gesture recognition system based solely on data from a single 3 dimensional accelerometer . \\n'],\n",
              " [' We propose two novel language models to improve the performance of sentence retrieval in Question Answering class based language model and trained trigger language model . As the search in sentence retrieval is conducted over smaller segments of text than in document retrieval the problems of data sparsity and exact matching become more critical . Different techniques such as the translation model are also proposed to overcome the word mismatch problem . Our class based and trained trigger language models however use different approaches to this aim and are shown to outperform the exiting models . The class model uses word clustering algorithm to capture term relationships . In this model we assume a relation between the terms that belong to the same clusters as a result they can be substituted when searching for relevant sentences . The trigger model captures pairs of trigger and target words while training on a large corpus . The model considers a relation between a question and a sentence if a trigger word appears in the question and the sentence contains the corresponding target word . For both proposed models we introduce different notions of co occurrence to find word relations . In addition we study the impact of corpus size and domain on the models . Our experiments on TREC QA collection verify that the proposed model significantly improves the sentence retrieval performance compared to the state of the art translation model . While the translation model based on mutual information has 0.3927 Mean Average Precision the class model achieves 0.4174 MAP and the trigger model enhances the performance to 0.4381 . \\n'],\n",

The idea of the proposed method is based on embedding the watermark with the SVD algorithm in the reflectance component after applying the homomorphic transform . The reflectance component contains most of the image features but with low energy and hence watermarks embedded in this component will be invisible . A block by block implementation of the proposed method is also introduced . The watermark embedding on a block by block basis makes the watermark more robust to attacks . A comparison study between the proposed method and the traditional SVD watermarking method is presented in the presence of attacks . The proposed method is more robust to various attacks . The embedding of chaotic encrypted watermarks is also investigated in this paper to increase the level of security . \\n'],\n",

It involves decisions regarding production inventory internal transportation sales and distribution to customers . The problem is motivated by the context of a company in the speciality oils industry . The overall objective at tactical level is to maximize contribution and in order to achieve this the planning has been divided into two separate problems . The first problem concerns sales where the final sales and distribution planning is decentralized to individual sellers . The second problem concerns production transportation and inventory planning through refineries hubs and depots and is managed centrally with the aim of minimizing costs . Due to this decoupling the solution of the two problems needs to be coordinated in order to achieve the overall objective . In the company this is pursued through an internal price system aiming at giving the sellers the incentives needed to align their decisions with the overall objective . We propose and discuss linear programming models for the decoupled and integrated planning problems . We present numerical examples to illustrate potential effects of integration and coordination and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the integrated over the decoupled approach . While the total contribution is higher in the integrated approach it has also been found that the sellers contribution can be considerably lower . Therefore we also suggest contribution sharing rules to achieve a solution where both the company and the sellers attain a better outcome under the integrated planning . \\n'],\n",

Moreover in order to answer factoid questions the system evaluates sentences of the filtered paragraphs ranked by the previous module of our framework . After this phase the system extracts one or more words from the ranked sentences based on a set of hand made patterns and ranks them to find the final answer . We have used Text Retrieval Conference QA track questions web data and AQUAINT and AQUAINT 2 datasets for training and testing our system .

To effectively assist users to find their desired resources it is critical to understand user behaviors and preferences . Tag based profile techniques which model users and resources by a vector of relevant tags are widely employed in folksonomy based systems . This is mainly because that personalized search and recommendations can be facilitated by measuring relevance between user profiles and resource profiles . However conventional measurements neglect the sentiment aspect of user generated tags . In fact tags can be very emotional and subjective as users usually express their perceptions and feelings about the resources by tags . Therefore it is necessary to take sentiment relevance into account into measurements . In this paper we present a novel generic framework SenticRank to incorporate various sentiment information to various sentiment based information for personalized search by user profiles and resource profiles . In this framework content based sentiment ranking and collaborative sentiment ranking methods are proposed to obtain sentiment based personalized ranking . To the best of our knowledge this is the first work of integrating sentiment information to address the problem of the personalized tag based search in collaborative tagging systems . Moreover we compare the proposed sentiment based personalized search with baselines in the experiments the results of which have verified the effectiveness of the proposed framework .

This paper describes and quantifies the economic and technical challenges associated with deepening wireless networks to meet this growing demand . Methods of capacity expansion divide into three general categories the deployment of more radio spectrum more intensive geographic reuse of spectrum and increasing the throughput capacity of each MHz of spectrum within a given geographic area . The paper describes these several basic methods to deepen mobile wireless capacity . It goes on to measure the contribution of each of these methods to historical capacity growth within U.S. networks . The paper then describes the capabilities of 4G LTE wireless technology and further innovations off of it to further improve network capacity . These capacity expansion capabilities of LTE Advanced along with traditional spectrum reuse are quantified and compared to forecasts of future demand to evaluate the ability of U.S. networks to match future demand . Without significantly increasing current spectrum allocations by 560MHz over the 2014 2022 period the presented model suggests that U.S. wireless capacity expansion will be inadequate to accommodate expected demand growth . This conclusion is in contrast to claims that the U.S. faces no spectrum shortage . \\n'],\n",

Movie summarization condenses a full length movie into a summary that still retains the most significant and interesting content of the original movie . In the past several movie summarization systems have been proposed to generate a movie summary based on low level video features such as color motion texture etc . However a generic summary which is common to everyone and is produced based only on low level video features will not satisfy every user . As users preferences for the summary differ vastly for the same movie there is a need for a personalized movie summarization system nowadays . To address this demand this paper proposes a novel system to generate semantically meaningful video summaries for the same movie which are tailored to the preferences and interests of a user . For a given movie shots and scenes are automatically detected and their high level features are semi automatically annotated . Preferences over high level movie features are explicitly collected from the user using a query interface . The user preferences are generated by means of a stored query . Movie summaries are generated at shot level and scene level where shots or scenes are selected for summary skim based on the similarity measured between shots and scenes and the user s preferences . The proposed movie summarization system is evaluated subjectively using a sample of 20 subjects with eight movies in the English language . The quality of the generated summaries is assessed by informativeness enjoyability relevance and acceptance metrics and Quality of Perception measures . Further the usability of the proposed summarization system is subjectively evaluated by conducting a questionnaire survey .

The problem is modeled as a time expanded transshipment network which is defined by the nodes and arcs that can be reached by feasible material flows . A mixed integer nonlinear programming model is developed to determine an optimal inventory policy that coordinates the transfer of materials between consecutive stages of the supply chain from period to period while properly placing purchasing orders to selected suppliers and satisfying customer demand on time . The proposed model minimizes the total variable cost including purchasing production inventory and transportation costs . The model can be linearized for certain types of cost structures . In addition two continuous and concave approximations of the transportation cost function are provided to simplify the model and reduce its computational time . \\n'],\n",

Identifying influential nodes has been among one of the most intensively studies of analyzing the structure of networks . There are a multitude of evaluation indicators of node importance in social networks such as degree betweenness and cumulative nomination and so on . But most of the indicators only reveal one characteristic of the node . In fact in social networks node importance is not affected by a single factor but is affected by a number of factors . Therefore the paper puts forward a relatively comprehensive and effective method of evaluation node importance in social networks by using the multi objective decision method . Firstly we select several different representative indicators given a certain weight . We regard each node as a solution and different indicators of each node as the solution properties . Then through calculating the closeness degree of each node to the ideal solution we obtain evaluation indicator of node importance in social networks . Finally we verify the effectiveness of the proposed method experimentally on a few actual social networks . \\n'],\n",

However despite a series of studies on the drivers of cloud adoption evidence of its economic effects is lacking possibly because many of the datasets on cloud computing are of insufficient size and often lack a time dimension as well as precise definitions of cloud computing thus making them unsuitable for rigorous quantitative analysis . To overcome these limitations we propose a proxy variable for cloud computing usage cloud adaptiveness based on survey panel data from European firms . Observations based on a descriptive analysis suggest three important aspects for further research . First cloud studies should be conducted at the industry level as cloud computing adaptiveness differs widely across industry sectors . Second it is important to know what firms do with cloud computing to understand the economic mechanisms and effects triggered by this innovation . And third cloud adaptiveness is potentially correlated to a firm s position in the supply chain and thus the type of output it produces as well as the market in which it operates . Our indicator can be employed to further analyze the effects of cloud computing in the context of firm heterogeneity . \\n'],\n",

Topic modeling is a branch of machine learning and probabilistic graphical modeling that helps in arranging the web pages according to their topical structure . The topic distribution over a set of documents and the affinity of a document toward a specific topic can be revealed using topic modeling . Topic modeling algorithms are typically computationally expensive due to their iterative nature . Recent research efforts have attempted to parallelize specific topic models and are successful in their attempts . These parallel algorithms however have tightly coupled parallel processes which require frequent synchronization and are also tightly coupled with the underlying topic model which is used for inferring the topic hierarchy . In this paper we propose a parallel algorithm to infer topic hierarchies from a large scale document corpus . A key feature of the proposed algorithm is that it exploits coarse grained parallelism and the components running in parallel need not synchronize after every iteration thus the algorithm lends itself to be implemented on a geographically dispersed set of processing elements interconnected through a network . The parallel algorithm realizes a speed up of 53.5 on a 32 node cluster of dual core workstations and at the same time achieving approximately the same likelihood or predictive accuracy as that of the sequential algorithm with respect to the performance of Information Retrieval tasks . \\n'],\n",

The problem examined calls for the determination of the optimal routes for a vehicle fleet to satisfy a mix of two different request types . Firstly vehicles must transport three dimensional rectangular and stackable boxes from a depot to a set of predetermined customers . In addition vehicles must also transfer products between pairs of pick up and delivery locations . Service of both request types is subject to hard time window constraints . In addition feasible palletization patterns must be identified for the transported products . A practical application of the problem arises in the transportation systems of chain stores where vehicles replenish the retail points by delivering products stored at a central depot while they are also responsible for transferring stock between pairs of the retailer network . To solve this very complex combinatorial optimization problem our major objective was to develop an efficient methodology whose required computational effort is kept within reasonable limits . To this end we propose a local search based framework for optimizing vehicle routes in which feasible loading arrangements are identified via a simple structured packing heuristic .

We present five general strategies for this group finding task given a heterogenous document repository . The models are formalized using generative language models . Two of the models aggregate expertise scores of the experts in the same group for the task one locates documents associated with experts in the group and then determines how closely the documents are associated with the topic whilst the remaining two models directly estimate the degree to which a group is a knowledgeable group for a given topic . For evaluation purposes we construct a test collection based on the TREC 2005 and 2006 Enterprise collections and define three types of ground truth for our task . Experimental results show that our five knowledgeable group finding models achieve high absolute scores . We also find significant differences between different ways of estimating the association between a topic and a group . \\n'],\n",

Our approach further shifts the boundaries of the state of the art by providing more accurate stemming results . The idea of the approach consists in building a stemmer in two stages . In the first stage a stemming algorithm based upon clustering which exploits the lexical and semantic information of words is used to prepare large scale training data for the second stage algorithm . The second stage algorithm uses a maximum entropy classifier . The stemming specific features help the classifier decide when and how to stem a particular word . In our research we have pursued the goal of creating a multi purpose stemming tool . Its design opens up possibilities of solving non traditional tasks such as approximating lemmas or improving language modeling . However we still aim at very good results in the traditional task of information retrieval . The conducted tests reveal exceptional performance in all the above mentioned tasks . Our stemming method is compared with three state of the art statistical algorithms and one rule based algorithm . We used corpora in the Czech Slovak Polish Hungarian Spanish and English languages . In the tests our algorithm excels in stemming previously unseen words . Moreover it was discovered that our approach demands very little text data for training when compared with competing unsupervised algorithms . \\n'],\n",

It is shown that the solutions of the Markowitz optimization problem and the quadratic utility problem are not always mean variance efficient . The conditions for the mean variance efficiency of the solutions depend on the unknown parameters of the asset returns . We deal with the problem of parameter uncertainty in detail and derive the probabilities that the estimated solutions of the Markowitz problem and the quadratic utility problem are mean variance efficient . Because these probabilities deviate from one the above mentioned quadratic optimization problems are not stochastically equivalent .

The reputation polarity of a tweet is a measure of how the tweet influences the reputation of a brand or company . We consider the task of automatically determining the reputation polarity of a tweet . For this classification task we propose a feature based model based on three dimensions the source of the tweet the contents of the tweet and the reception of the tweet i.e . how the tweet is being perceived . For evaluation purposes we make use of the RepLab 2012 and 2013 datasets . We study and contrast three training scenarios . The first is independent of the entity whose reputation is being managed the second depends on the entity at stake but has over 90 fewer training samples per model on average . The third is dependent on the domain of the entities . We find that reputation polarity is different from sentiment and that having less but entity dependent training data is significantly more effective for predicting the reputation polarity of a tweet than an entity independent training scenario . Features related to the reception of a tweet perform significantly better than most other features . \\n'],\n",

Then we detail the relation between risk averse decisions under the dual theory of choice and spectral risk measures . This relation is identified as the fundamental reason why it is not in general possible to establish a simple one to one mapping between expected utility theory and spectral risk measures . We are nonetheless able to use spectral risk measures to model decisions obtained using expected utility theory .

However the methodology does not permit us to identify specific sources of inefficiency because DEA views the DMU as a black box that consumes a mix of inputs and produces a mix of outputs . Thus DEA does not provide a DMU manager with insight regarding the internal source of the organization s inefficiency . Recent methodological developments have extended the basic DEA methodology to allow the analyst to look inside the DMU and model the network of production processes that comprise the organization . In such models sub DMUs consume inputs from outside the DMU and intermediate products from other sub DMUs to produce outputs that flow out of the DMU and intermediate products that flow into other sub DMUs . In this paper we present an unoriented two stage DEA model to measure efficiency in situations in which analysts seek to simultaneously reduce input quantities and increase output quantities . The methodology extends previous work in which the model must be either input oriented or output oriented . The key to the methodology is an iterative algorithm that alternates between an input oriented push backward step and an output oriented push forward step that is characterized by damped oscillations in the intermediate products . We apply the methodology to Major League Baseball teams during the 2009 season to demonstrate how this approach provides a deeper understanding of each team s operations . \\n'],\n",

Among different translation resources we focus on obtaining translation models from comparable corpora because they provide appropriate translations for both languages and domains with limited linguistic resources . In this paper we employ a two step approach to build an effective translation model from comparable corpora without requiring any additional linguistic resources for the CLIR task . In the first step translations are extracted by deriving correlations between source target word pairs . These correlations are used to estimate word translation probabilities in the second step . We propose a language modeling approach for the first step where modeling based on probability distribution provides two key advantages . First our approach can be tuned easier in comparison with heuristically adjusted previous work . Second it provides a principled basis for integrating additional lexical and translational relations to improve the accuracy of translations from comparable corpora . As an indication we integrate monolingual relations of word co occurrences into the process of translation extraction which helps to extract more reliable translations for low frequency words in a comparable corpus . Experimental results on an English Persian comparable corpus show that our method outperforms the previous approaches in terms of both translation quality and the performance of CLIR . Indeed the proposed method is naturally applicable to any comparable corpus regardless of its languages . In addition we demonstrate the significant impact of word translation probabilities estimated in the second step of our approach on the performance of CLIR . \\n'],\n",

In this paper we model a decentralised closed loop supply chain consisting of a key component supplier and a non integrated manufacturer and demonstrate that the interaction between these players significantly impacts the economic and environmental implications of remanufacturing . In our model the non integrated manufacturer can purchase new components from the supplier to produce new products and remanufacture used components to produce remanufactured products . Thus the non integrated manufacturer is not only a buyer but also a rival to the supplier . In a steady state period we analyse the performances of an integrated manufacturer and the decentralised supply chain . We find that although the integrated manufacturer always benefits from remanufacturing the remanufacturing opportunity may constitute a lose lose situation to the supplier and the non integrated manufacturer making their profits be lower than in an identical supply chain without remanufacturing . In addition the non integrated manufacturer may be worse off with a lower remanufacturing cost or a larger return rate of used products due to the interaction with the supplier . We further demonstrate that the government subsidised remanufacturing in the non integrated manufacturer is detrimental to the environment . \\n'],\n",

This problem arises in a franchising environment in which the decision makers are the franchisees and the franchiser defines the potential sites for locating services and the rules of the game . At most one service can be located at each site and one of the franchisees has preferential rights over the other . This means that if both franchisees are interested in opening the service in the same site only the one that has preferential rights will open it . We consider that both franchisees have budget constraints but the franchisee without preferential rights is allowed to show interest in more sites than the ones she can afford . We are interested in studying the influence of the existence of preferential rights and overbidding on the outcomes for both franchisees and franchiser . A model is presented and an algorithmic approach is developed for the calculation of Nash equilibria . Several computational experiments are defined and their results are analysed showing that preferential rights give its holder a relative advantage over the other competitor .

This paper presents an integrated model for the joint optimization of statistical process control and preventive maintenance . The proposed model is developed for a production process that deteriorates according to a discrete time Markov chain .

The formulation of the deterioration process with maintenance interventions formulated as a Markov chain provides a breakthrough in designing an efficient solution algorithm and obtaining analytical results . A numerical example is used to illustrate the proposed integrated statistical process control and preventive maintenance policies . Sensitivity analysis is conducted to analyze the impact of model parameters on optimal policies .

The former is a small area where most popular stock keeping units can conveniently be picked and the latter is applied for replenishing the forward area and storing SKUs that are not assigned to the forward area at all . Clearly reducing SKUs stored in forward area enables a more compact forward area but requires a more frequent replenishment . To tackle this basic trade off different versions of forward reserve problems determine the SKUs to be stored in forward area the space allocated to each SKU and the overall size of the forward area . As previous research mainly focuses on simplified problem versions where the forward area can continuously be subdivided we investigate discrete forward reserve problems .

In the past several approaches to assess similarity by evaluating the knowledge modeled in an ontology have been proposed . However there are some limitations such as the facts of relying on predefined ontologies and fitting non dynamic domains in the existing measures . Wikipedia provides a very large domain independent encyclopedic repository and semantic network for computing semantic similarity of concepts with more coverage than usual ontologies . In this paper we propose some novel feature based similarity assessment methods that are fully dependent on Wikipedia and can avoid most of the limitations and drawbacks introduced above . To implement similarity assessment based on feature by making use of Wikipedia firstly a formal representation of Wikipedia concepts is presented . We then give a framework for feature based similarity based on the formal representation of Wikipedia concepts . Lastly we investigate several feature based approaches to semantic similarity measures resulting from instantiations of the framework . The evaluation based on several widely used benchmarks and a benchmark developed in ourselves sustains the intuitions with respect to human judgements . Overall several methods proposed in this paper have good human correlation and constitute some effective ways of determining similarity between Wikipedia concepts . \\n'],\n",

However in real world settings collections and individual documents rarely stay unchanged over time . The World Wide Web is a prime example of a collection where information changes both frequently and significantly over time with documents being added modified or just deleted at different times . In this context previous work addressing the summarization of web documents has simply discarded the dynamic nature of the web considering only the latest published version of each individual document . This paper proposes and addresses a new challenge the automatic summarization of changes in dynamic text collections . In standard text summarization retrieval techniques present a summary to the user by capturing the major points expressed in the most recent version of an entire document in a condensed form . In this new task the goal is to obtain a summary that describes the most significant changes made to a document during a given period . In other words the idea is to have a summary of the revisions made to a document over a specific period of time . This paper proposes different approaches to generate summaries using extractive summarization techniques . First individual terms are scored and then this information is used to rank and select sentences to produce the final summary . A system based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation model is used to find the hidden topic structures of changes . The purpose of using the LDA model is to identify separate topics where the changed terms from each topic are likely to carry at least one significant change . The different approaches are then compared with the previous work in this area . A collection of articles from Wikipedia including their revision history is used to evaluate the proposed system . For each article a temporal interval and a reference summary from the article s content are selected manually . The articles and intervals in which a significant event occurred are carefully selected . The summaries produced by each of the approaches are evaluated comparatively to the manual summaries using ROUGE metrics . It is observed that the approach using the LDA model outperforms all the other approaches . Statistical tests reveal that the differences in ROUGE scores for the LDA based approach is statistically significant at 99 over baseline . \\n'],\n",

              " [' Demand based pricing is often used to moderate demand fluctuations so as to level resource utilization and increase profitability . However such pricing policies may not be effective when customers purchase decisions are influenced by social interactions . This paper investigates the demand dynamics under a demand based pricing policy of a frequently purchased service when social interactions are at work . Customers are heterogeneous and adaptively forward looking . Existing customers re purchase decisions are based on adaptively formed price expectations and reservation prices . Potential customers are attracted through social interactions with existing customers . The demand process is characterized by a two dimensional dynamical system . It is shown that the equilibrium demand can be unstable . For a given reservation price distribution we first analyze the stability of the equilibrium demand under various scenarios of social interactions and customers adaptively forward looking behavior and then characterize their dynamics using the bifurcation plots Lyapunov exponents and return maps . The results indicate that the demand process can be stable periodic or chaotic . The study shows that the intended effect of a demand based pricing policy may be offset by customers adaptively forward looking behavior under the influence of social interactions . In fact the interplay of these factors may even lead to chaotic demand dynamics . The result highlights the complex dynamics produced by a simple demand price mechanism under social interactions . For a demand based pricing strategy to be effective companies must take social interactions into account . \\n'],\n",

An algorithm was developed with the aim of minimizing the investment for constructing a gas distribution network with a tree shaped layout in which demands are fixed . The construction cost is known to depend on the pipe diameters used for each arc in the network . However under the assumption that pipe diameters are continuous we prove that it is possible to obtain the minimum construction cost directly and analytically by an iterating procedure that converts the original tree into a single equivalent arc . In addition we also show that expanding the converted single arc inversely to the original tree computes the optimal continuous pipe diameter for each arc . Following this we present an additional heuristic to convert optimal continuous pipe diameters into approximate discrete pipe diameters . The algorithms were evaluated by applying them to sample networks . The numerical results obtained by comparing the approximate discrete diameters with the optimal discrete diameters confirm the efficiency of our algorithms thereby demonstrating their suitability for designing real gas distribution networks . \\n'],\n",

These bounds are compared to the performance of several partial parking reservation policies a parking space overbooking policy and to the complete parking reservation and no reservation policies introduced in a previous paper . A detailed user behavior model for each policy is presented and a discrete event simulation is used to evaluate the performance of the system under various settings . The analysis of two case studies of real world systems shows the following a significant improvement of what can theoretically be achieved is obtained via the CPR policy the performances of the proposed partial reservation policies monotonically improve as more reservations are required and parking space overbooking is not likely to be beneficial .

This scheme specifies a fixed and periodic production sequence called a cycle where each product may occur more than once in the sequence . In order to stabilize the cycle length alternative control strategies are introduced . These strategies keep the cycle length close to a target length by means of adding idle time to the cycle cutting production short or overproduction . On basis of the selected control strategy as well as a base stock policy target inventory levels are determined for each production run in the cycle .

To further develop the linguistic term set this paper proposes a generalized asymmetric linguistic term set based on the asymmetric sigmoid semantics which belongs to an asymmetric and non uniform linguistic term set and can be used to address the QDM problems involving risk appetites of the decision maker . Then a value at risk fitting approach is designed for obtaining the risk appetite parameters of the GALTS and six desirable properties of the GALTS are analyzed i.e . asymmetry non uniformity generality variability range consistency and diminishing utility . Based on the above approaches and the generalized asymmetric linguistic preference relations a QDM process involving risk appetites of the DM is designed . Because the GALPRs consist of subjective information provided by the DM the process is not perfectly consistent and is usually difficult to change or repeat . Thus a transitivity improvement approach is investigated and the corresponding calculation steps are provided .

              " [' Today s power systems are experiencing a transition from primarily fossil fuel based generation toward greater shares of renewable energy sources . It becomes increasingly costly to manage the resulting uncertainty and variability in power system operations solely through flexible generation assets . Incorporating demand side flexibility through appropriately designed incentive structures can add an additional lever to balance demand and supply . Based on a supply model using empirical wind generation data and a discrete model of flexible demand with temporal constraints we design and evaluate a local online market mechanism for matching flexible load and uncertain supply . Under this mechanism truthful reporting of flexibility is a dominant strategy for consumers reducing payments and increasing the likelihood of allocation . Suppliers during periods of scarce supply benefit from elevated critical value payments as a result of flexibility induced competition on the demand side . We find that for a wide range of the key parameters the cost of ensuring incentive compatibility in a smart grid market relative to the welfare optimal matching is relatively small . This suggests that local matching of demand and supply can be organized in a decentral manner in the presence of a sufficiently flexible demand side . Extending the stylized demand model to include complementary demand structures we demonstrate that decentral matching induces only minor efficiency losses if demand is sufficiently flexible . Furthermore by accounting for physical grid limitations we show that flexibility and grid capacity exhibit complementary characteristics . \\n'],\n",

But what happens when different online media platforms take up the campaign comment re contextualize and evaluate it Relating to preliminary findings of persuasion research we postulate that source credibility perceptions vary across types of online media platforms and contextualization of the message . Individual characteristics in particular weight related factors are assumed to influence message effects . A 3 2 experimental design with students aged between 13 and 18 years was conducted . Results show an interaction between media type and argumentation for affective self perceptions of weight . Self relevance varies based on different source credibility perceptions . Overall campaign re contextualization of provocative messages may result in negative persuasion effects and needs to be considered in campaign development . Childhood anti obesity campaigns are often designed in a highly provocative way in order to increase attention . Social media platforms are a prominent online environment to spread such health related public service announcements raise awareness and motivate discussion . However when applying this strategy public healthcare runs the risk of losing control over the effects of its campaigns . Follow up communication in different media platforms such as blogs online news sites or social networking sites takes up the campaign comments re contextualizes and evaluates it . On the one hand this strengthens the attention focused on the campaign on the other hand the question emerges how different context formats affect campaign perceptions . Even if the core messages of the campaigns are still equal variations in the argumentative contextualization and the media platform change the representation of the message or in other words the frame of the message . In terms of how campaigns are embedded two aspects stand out . First the contextualization of the content could either reinforce the argumentation of the campaign or impair its original message . The arguments of the original message are either supported or rejected which resembles value framing in political communication . Second follow up communication regarding the campaigns could be placed on different online media platforms reaching from more traditional journalistic contexts such as online newspapers to social media environments such as Facebook or blogs . Both re contextualization factors address the credibility and trustworthiness of the context the message and of the communicator . However research has failed to analyze the comparative effects of social campaigns in these different online media environments . A highly relevant example in regard to such concerns is the perception of obesity related health messages especially when these campaigns address children and adolescents since such campaigns are increasingly at risk of offending and stigmatizing children affected by obesity . However there is little research on the effects of campaigns against childhood obesity and the fact that they convey negative or even shocking messages in online media .

This automatic post editing module learns to make its corrections from user feedback in real time by means of online learning techniques . We have validated our system using different translation technologies to implement the base translation system as well as several texts involving different domains and languages .

In general speech recognition systems are optimized to an average adult s voice and tend to exhibit a lower accuracy rate when recognizing an elderly person s voice due to the effects of speech articulation and speaking style . Additional costs are bound to be incurred when adding modifications to current speech recognitions systems for better speech recognition among elderly users . Thus using a preprocessing application on a smart device can not only deliver better speech recognition but also substantially reduce any added costs . Audio samples of 50 words uttered by 80 elderly and young adults were collected and comparatively analyzed . The speech patterns of the elderly have a slower speech rate with longer inter syllabic silence length and slightly lower speech intelligibility . The speech recognition rate for elderly adults could be improved by means of increasing the speech rate adding a 1.5 increase in accuracy eliminating silence periods adding another 4.2 increase in accuracy and boosting the energy of the formant frequency bands for a 6 boost in accuracy . After all the preprocessing a 12 increase in the accuracy of elderly speech recognition was achieved . Through this study we show that speech recognition of elderly voices can be improved through modifying specific aspects of differences in speech articulation and speaking style .

Two studies one correlational based on a sample of 207 American participants and the other experimental based on a sample of 194 German participants were conducted in 2014 . In Study 2 envy was further distinguished into benign and malicious envy .

Facebook continuously keeps users updated with a variety of posts and passive consumption of news updates is the main Facebook activity that people engage in . The majority of these updates are positive . There is evidence for emotional contagion showing happiness can spread through the news updates on online social networks . However recent studies also indicate that exposure to positive posts on Facebook may induce envy and lead to depression and reduced well being over time . Given that Facebook has over 1.35 billion active users and there are on average 1500 potential stories for users to check per visit we are eager to understand how Facebook affects users emotions and identify relevant factors that will determine emotional reactions . We argue that tie strength between the user and the poster is one important factor that should affect emotional outcomes . The use of social media such as Facebook can cause both positive and negative feelings and the results of prior studies on the psychological effects of social media usage are quite mixed . From a long term perspective the use of social media offers benefits such as the possibility of developing and maintaining social capital and social connectedness Nevertheless it may also lead to negative outcomes such as social overload an over optimistic perception towards others lives and a decrease in life satisfaction . From a short term perspective the use of Facebook can evoke a feeling of flow which is characterized by high positive valence and high arousal and joyful and fun are the most common positive feelings reported by users while using Facebook . Nonetheless the consumption of social news on Facebook can also trigger invidious emotions such as jealousy and envy . Faced with mixed results from prior research on the psychological effects of Facebook usage it is important to differentiate between interactive and non interactive social media behavior . Previous research has shown a consistent relation between using FB for interpersonal interaction. \\n'],\n",

We compare our approach with the question specific and monolingual translation based methods presented in previous works . The question specific method extracts question dependent answer words from social Q A pairs in which the questions resemble the submitted question . The monolingual translation based method learns word to word translation probabilities from all of the social Q A pairs without considering the question or its type . Experiments on the extension of the NTCIR 2008 Chinese test data set demonstrate that our models that exploit social Q A collections are significantly more effective than baseline methods such as LexRank .

This study aimed to examine the relationship between social casino gaming and gambling through an online survey of 521 adults who played social casino games in the previous 12 months . Most social casino game users reported that these games had no impact on how much they gambled . However 9.6 reported that their gambling overall had increased and 19.4 reported that they had gambled for money as a direct result of these games . Gambling as a direct result of social casino games was more common among males younger users those with higher levels of problem gambling severity and more involved social casino game users in terms of game play frequency and in game payments . The most commonly reported reason for gambling as a result of playing social casino games was to win real money .

Although automatic evaluation of speech intelligibility and quality could come in handy in these scenarios to assist experts in diagnosis and treatment design the many sources and types of variability often make it a very challenging computational processing problem . In this work we propose novel sentence level features to capture abnormal variation in the prosodic voice quality and pronunciation aspects in pathological speech . In addition we propose a post classification posterior smoothing scheme which refines the posterior of a test sample based on the posteriors of other test samples . Finally we perform feature level fusions and subsystem decision fusion for arriving at a final intelligibility decision . The performances are tested on two pathological speech datasets the NKI CCRT Speech Corpus and the TORGO database by evaluating classification accuracy without overlapping subjects data among training and test partitions . Results show that the feature sets of each of the voice quality subsystem prosodic subsystem and pronunciation subsystem offer significant discriminating power for binary intelligibility classification . We observe that the proposed posterior smoothing in the acoustic space can further reduce classification errors . The smoothed posterior score fusion of subsystems shows the best classification performance . \\n'],\n",

This approach is mostly helpful for readers and language students but writers sometimes need to find a word that encompasses a set of ideas that they have in mind . For this task inverse dictionaries are ready to help however in some cases a sought word does not correspond to a single definition but to a composite meaning of several concepts . A language producer then tends to require a concept search that starts with a group of words or a series of related terms looking for a target word . This paper aims to assist on this task by presenting a new approach for concept blending through the development of a search by concept method based on vector space representation using semantic analysis and statistical natural language processing techniques . Words are represented as numeric vectors based on different semantic similarity measures and probabilistic measures the semantic properties of a word are captured in the vector elements determined by a given linguistic context . Three different sources are used as context for word vector construction WordNet a distributional thesaurus and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm each source is used for building a different semantic vector space . The concept blender input is then conformed by a set of n nouns . All input members are read and substituted by their corresponding vectors . Then a semantic space analysis including a filtering and ranking process is carried out to deploy a list of target words . A test set of 50 concepts was created in order to evaluate the system s performance .

The synthesized 4D images possess explicit patient motion while maintaining the geometric accuracy of patient s anatomy at the time of treatment . We validated our model by quantitatively comparing the synthesized 4D CBCT against the 4D CT dataset acquired in the same day from protocol patients undergoing daily in room CBCT setup and weekly 4D CT for treatment evaluation .

To determine correspondences between MR brain images most existing methods typically perform a local neighborhood search based on certain morphological features . They are limited in two aspects pre defined morphological features often have limited power in characterizing brain structures thus leading to inaccurate correspondence detection and correspondence matching is often restricted within local small neighborhoods and fails to cater to images with large anatomical difference . To address these limitations we propose a novel method to detect distinctive landmarks for effective correspondence matching . Specifically we first annotate a group of landmarks in a large set of training MR brain images . Then we use regression forest to simultaneously learn the optimal sets of features to best characterize each landmark and the non linear mappings from the local patch appearances of image points to their 3D displacements towards each landmark . The learned regression forests are used as landmark detectors to predict the locations of these landmarks in new images . Because each detector is learned based on features that best distinguish the landmark from other points and also landmark detection is performed in the entire image domain our method can address the limitations in conventional methods . The deformation field estimated based on the alignment of these detected landmarks can then be used as initialization for image registration . Experimental results show that our method is capable of providing good initialization even for the images with large deformation difference thus improving registration accuracy . \\n'],\n",

For this use manual segmentation is cumbersome and impractical for humanoid robots . In this study we propose a novel approach to segmentation the Real time Unsupervised Segmentation method which comprises three phases .

This approach has been supported by many software providers who have provided a wide range of mash up tools for creating composite applications based on components prepared by the respective provider . These tools aim to achieve the end user development of rich internet applications however most having failed to meet the needs of end users without programming knowledge have been unsuccessful . Thus many studies have investigated success factors in order to propose scales of success factor objectives and assess the adequacy of mashup tools for their purpose . After reviewing much of the available literature this paper proposes a new success factor scale based on human factors human computer interaction factors and the specialization functionality relationship . It brings together all these factors offering a general conception of EUD success factors . The proposed scale was applied in an empirical study on current EUD tools which found that today s EUD tools have many shortcomings . In order to achieve an acceptable success rate among end users we then designed a mashup tool architecture called FAST Wirecloud which was built taking into account the proposed EUD success factor scale . The results of a new empirical study carried out using this tool have demonstrated that users are better able to successfully develop their composite applications and that FAST Wirecloud has scored higher than all the other tools under study on all scales of measurement and particularly on the scale proposed in this paper . \\n'],\n",
              " [' Objective Machine learning techniques can be used to extract predictive models for diseases from electronic medical records . However the nature of EMRs makes it difficult to apply off the shelf machine learning techniques while still exploiting the rich content of the EMRs . In this paper we explore the usage of a range of natural language processing techniques to extract valuable predictors from uncoded consultation notes and study whether they can help to improve predictive performance . Methods We study a number of existing techniques for the extraction of predictors from the consultation notes namely a bag of words based approach and topic modeling . In addition we develop a dedicated technique to match the uncoded consultation notes with a medical ontology . We apply these techniques as an extension to an existing pipeline to extract predictors from EMRs . We evaluate them in the context of predictive modeling for colorectal cancer a disease known to be difficult to diagnose before performing an endoscopy . Results Our results show that we are able to extract useful information from the consultation notes . The predictive performance of the ontology based extraction method moves significantly beyond the benchmark of age and gender alone of 0.870 versus 0.831 . We also observe more accurate predictive models by adding features derived from processing the consultation notes compared to solely using coded data although the difference is not significant . The extracted features from the notes are shown be equally predictive compared to the coded data of the consultations . Conclusion It is possible to extract useful predictors from uncoded consultation notes that improve predictive performance . Techniques linking text to concepts in medical ontologies to derive these predictors are shown to perform best for predicting CRC in our EMR dataset . \\n'],\n",

It is a time consuming trial and error process that requires the expertise of a group of medical experts including oncologists and medical physicists and can take from 2 to 3h to a few days . Our objective is to improve the performance of our previously built case based reasoning system for brain tumour radiotherapy treatment planning . In this system a treatment plan for a new patient is retrieved from a case base containing patient cases treated in the past and their treatment plans . However this system does not perform any adaptation which is needed to account for any difference between the new and retrieved cases . Generally the adaptation phase is considered to be intrinsically knowledge intensive and domain dependent . Therefore an adaptation often requires a large amount of domain specific knowledge which can be difficult to acquire and often is not readily available . In this study we investigate approaches to adaptation that do not require much domain knowledge referred to as knowledge light adaptation . Methodology We developed two adaptation approaches adaptation based on machine learning tools and adaptation guided retrieval . They were used to adapt the beam number and beam angles suggested in the retrieved case . Two machine learning tools neural networks and naive Bayes classifier were used in the adaptation to learn how the difference in attribute values between the retrieved and new cases affects the output of these two cases . The adaptation guided retrieval takes into consideration not only the similarity between the new and retrieved cases but also how to adapt the retrieved case . Results The research was carried out in collaboration with medical physicists at the Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust City Hospital Campus UK . All experiments were performed using real world brain cancer patient cases treated with three dimensional conformal radiotherapy . Neural networks based adaptation improved the success rate of the CBR system with no adaptation by 12 . However naive Bayes classifier did not improve the current retrieval results as it did not consider the interplay among attributes . The adaptation guided retrieval of the case for beam number improved the success rate of the CBR system by 29 . However it did not demonstrate good performance for the beam angle adaptation . Its success rate was 29 versus 39 when no adaptation was performed . Conclusions The obtained empirical results demonstrate that the proposed adaptation methods improve the performance of the existing CBR system in recommending the number of beams to use . However we also conclude that to be effective the proposed adaptation of beam angles requires a large number of relevant cases in the case base . \\n'],\n",

The ability to predict the treatment outcome can help to design the treatment planning and can thus be beneficial to the patient . We aim to select predictive features from clinical and PET based features in order to provide doctors with informative factors so as to anticipate the outcome of the patient treatment . Methods In order to overcome the small sample size problem of datasets usually met in the medical domain we propose a novel wrapper feature selection algorithm named HFS which searches forward in a hierarchical feature subset space . Feature subsets are iteratively evaluated with the prediction performance using SVM . All feature subsets performing better than those at the preceding iteration are retained . Moreover as SUV based features have been recognized as significant predictive factors for a patient outcome we propose to incorporate this prior knowledge into the selection procedure to improve its robustness and reduce its computational cost . Results Two real world datasets from cancer patients are included in the evaluation . We extract dozens of clinical and PET based features to characterize the patient s state including SUV parameters and texture features . We use leave one out cross validation to evaluate the prediction performance in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness . Using SVM as the classifier our HFS method produces accuracy values of 100 and 94 on the two datasets respectively and robustness values of 89 and 96 . Without accuracy loss the prior based version improves the robustness up to 100 and 98 on the two datasets respectively . Conclusions Compared with other feature selection methods the proposed HFS and pHFS provide the most promising results . For our HFS method we have empirically shown that the addition of prior knowledge improves the robustness and accelerates the convergence . \\n'],\n",

Primarily due to the plethora of electronically available data from the medical literature the manual appraisal of the quality of evidence is a time consuming process . We present a fully automatic approach for predicting the quality of medical evidence in order to aid practitioners at point of care . Methods Our approach extracts relevant information from medical article abstracts and utilises data from a specialised corpus to apply supervised machine learning for the prediction of the quality grades . Following an in depth analysis of the usefulness of features they are extracted from the text via rule based approaches and from the meta data associated with the articles and then applied in the supervised classification model . We propose the use of a highly scalable and portable approach using a sequence of high precision classifiers and introduce a simple evaluation metric called average error distance that simplifies the comparison of systems . We also perform elaborate human evaluations to compare the performance of our system against human judgments . Results We test and evaluate our approaches on a publicly available specialised annotated corpus containing 1132 evidence based recommendations . Our rule based approach performs exceptionally well at the automatic extraction of publication types of articles with F scores of up to 0.99 for high quality publication types . For evidence quality classification our approach obtains an accuracy of 63.84 and an AED of 0.271 . The human evaluations show that the performance of our system in terms of AED and accuracy is comparable to the performance of humans on the same data .

Despite the large availability of protein protein interaction information not much information is available about protein complexes . Experimental methods are limited in terms of time efficiency cost and performance constraints . Existing computational methods have provided encouraging preliminary results but they phase certain disadvantages as they require parameter tuning some of them can not handle weighted PPI data and others do not allow a protein to participate in more than one protein complex . In the present paper we propose a new fully unsupervised methodology for predicting protein complexes from weighted PPI graphs . Methods and materials The proposed methodology is called evolutionary enhanced Markov clustering and it is a hybrid combination of an adaptive evolutionary algorithm and a state of the art clustering algorithm named enhanced Markov clustering . EE MC was compared with state of the art methodologies when applied to datasets from the human and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae organisms . Results Using public available datasets EE MC outperformed existing methodologies . Moreover when applied to new human datasets its performance was encouraging in the prediction of protein complexes which consist of proteins with high functional similarity . In specific 5737 protein complexes were predicted and 72.58 of them are enriched for at least one gene ontology function term . Conclusions EE MC is by design able to overcome intrinsic limitations of existing methodologies such as their inability to handle weighted PPI networks their constraint to assign every protein in exactly one cluster and the difficulties they face concerning the parameter tuning . This fact was experimentally validated and moreover new potentially true human protein complexes were suggested as candidates for further validation using experimental techniques . \\n'],\n",

Planning of postoperative ICU admissions is important as ICUs often have no nonoccupied beds available . Problem statement Estimation of the ICU bed availability for the next coming days is entirely based on clinical judgement by intensivists and therefore too inaccurate . For this reason predictive models have much potential for improving planning for ICU patient admission . Objective Our goal is to develop and optimize models for patient survival and ICU length of stay based on monitored ICU patient data . Furthermore these models are compared on their use of sequential organ failure scores as well as underlying raw data as input features . Methodology Different machine learning techniques are trained using a 14 480 patient dataset both on SOFA scores as well as their underlying raw data values from the first five days after admission in order to predict the patient LOS and the patient mortality . Furthermore to help physicians in assessing the prediction credibility a probabilistic model is tailored to the output of our best performing model assigning a belief to each patient status prediction . A two by two grid is built using the classification outputs of the mortality and prolonged stay predictors to improve the patient LOS regression models . Results For predicting patient mortality and a prolonged stay the best performing model is a support vector machine with G A D 65.9 of 0.77 and G S L 73.2 . In terms of LOS regression the best performing model is support vector regression achieving a mean absolute error of 1.79 days and a median absolute error of 1.22 days for those patients surviving a nonprolonged stay . Conclusion Using a classification grid based on the predicted patient mortality and prolonged stay allows more accurate modeling of the patient LOS . The detailed models allow to support the decisions made by physicians in an ICU setting . \\n'],\n",

Method The method is based on applying a range of recent BN developments targeted at helping experts build BNs given limited data . While most of the components of the method are based on established work its novelty is that it provides a rigorous consolidated and generalised framework that addresses the whole life cycle of BN model development . The method is based on two original and recent validated BN models in forensic psychiatry known as DSVM MSS and DSVM P. Results When employed with the same datasets the DSVM MSS demonstrated competitive to superior predictive performance against the state of the art and the DSVM P demonstrated superior predictive performance against the state of the art . More importantly the resulting models go beyond improving predictive accuracy and into usefulness for risk management purposes through intervention and enhanced decision support in terms of answering complex clinical questions that are based on unobserved evidence . Conclusions This development process is applicable to any application domain which involves large scale decision analysis based on such complex information rather than based on data with hard facts and in conjunction with the incorporation of expert knowledge for decision support via intervention . The novelty extends to challenging the decision scientists to reason about building models based on what information is really required for inference rather than based on what data is available and hence forces decision scientists to use available data in a much smarter way . \\n'],\n",

To define the approximation bases in the space domain complete sets of orthonormal Legendre polynomials are used .

The developed methods can be used for decision making of incomplete 0 1 information systems which are generated by the conjunction of two experts incomplete 0 1 evaluation results . Whenever the available information is not enough for choosing a necessarily optimal solution the elicitation algorithms can help elicitate as few unknown values as possible until an optimal result is found . An elicitation system is made to show that our elicitation methods can potentially be embedded in recommender or decision support systems . The elicitation problems are proposed for decision making of operation generated soft sets by extracting from some practical problems . The concept of expected elicitation times of objects is defined and used for developing one type of elicitation strategy . \\n'],\n",

For enhanced low rank recovery and error correction our method constructs a low rank tensor subspace to reconstruct given images along row and column directions simultaneously by computing two low rank matrices alternately from a nuclear norm minimization problem so both column and row information of data can be effectively preserved . Our bilinear approach seamlessly integrates the low rank coding and dictionary learning into a unified framework . Thus our formulation can be treated as enhanced Inductive Robust Principal Component Analysis with noise removed by low rank representation and can also be considered as the enhanced low rank representation with a clean informative dictionary via low rank embedding .

The characteristics of the non Latin script document such as Thai are considerably more complicated than the Latin script document and include many levels of character alignment no word or sentence separator and variability in a character s size . When applying an image processing technique to a Thai document we usually remove the characters that are relatively close to noise . Hence in this paper we propose a novel noise reduction method by applying a machine learning technique to classify and reduce noise in document images . The proposed method uses a semi supervised cluster and label approach with an improved labeling method namely feature selected sub cluster labeling . Feature selected sub cluster labeling focuses on the clusters that are incorrectly labeled by conventional labeling methods . These clusters are re clustered into small groups with a new feature set that is selected according to class labels . The experimental results show that this method can significantly improve the accuracy of labeling examples and the performance of classification . We compared the performance of noise reduction and character preservation between the proposed method and two related noise reduction approaches i.e . a two phased stroke like pattern noise removal and a commercial noise reduction software called ScanFix Xpress 6.0 . The results show that semi supervised noise reduction is significantly better than the compared methods of which an F measure of character and noise is 86.01 and 97.82 respectively . \\n'],\n",

When there is a lack of sufficient data knowledge and experience for a decision maker to generate attribute weights the decision maker may expect to find the most satisfactory solution based on unknown attribute weights called a robust solution in this study . To generate such a solution this paper proposes a robust evidential reasoning approach to compare alternatives by measuring their robustness with respect to attribute weights in the ER context . Alternatives that can become the best with the support of one or more sets of attribute weights are firstly identified . The measurement of robustness of each identified alternative from two perspectives i.e . the optimal situation of the alternative and the insensitivity of the alternative to a variation in attribute weights is then presented . The procedure of the proposed approach is described based on the combination of such identification of alternatives and the measurement of their robustness . A problem of car performance assessment is investigated to show that the proposed approach can effectively produce a robust solution to a MADM problem with unknown attribute weights . \\n'],\n",

              " [' This paper proposes a novel training algorithm for radial basis function neural networks based on fuzzy clustering and particle swarm optimization . So far fuzzy clustering has proven to be a very efficient tool in designing such kind of networks . The motivation of the current work is to quantify the exact effect of fuzzy cluster analysis on the network s performance and use it in order to substantially improve this performance . There are two key theoretical findings resulting from the present work . First it is analytically proved that when the standard fuzzy c means algorithm is used to generate the input space fuzzy partition the main effect this partition imposes to the network s square error can be written down in terms of a distortion function that measures the ability of the partition to recreate the original data . Second using the aforementioned distortion function an upper bound of the network s square error can be constructed . Then the particle swarm optimization is put in place to minimize the above upper bound and determine the network s parameters . To further improve the accuracy the basis function widths and the connection weights are fine tuned by employing a steepest descent approach . The main experimental findings are the implementation of the PSO obtains a significant reduction of the square error while exhibiting a smooth dynamic behavior although the steepest descent further decreases the error it finally obtains smaller reduction rates meaning that the strongest impact on the error reduction is provided by the PSO and the improved performance of the proposed network is demonstrated through an extensive comparison with other related methods using a 10 fold cross validation analysis . \\n'],\n",
              " [' We propose a new method to incorporate priors on the solution of nonnegative matrix factorization . The NMF solution is guided to follow the minimum mean square error estimates of the weight combinations under a Gaussian mixture model prior . The proposed algorithm can be used for denoising or single channel source separation applications . NMF is used in SCSS in two main stages the training stage and the separation stage . In the training stage NMF is used to decompose the training data spectrogram for each source into a multiplication of a trained basis and gains matrices . In the separation stage the mixed signal spectrogram is decomposed as a weighted linear combination of the trained basis matrices for the source signals . In this work to improve the separation performance of NMF the trained gains matrices are used to guide the solution of the NMF weights during the separation stage . The trained gains matrix is used to train a prior GMM that captures the statistics of the valid weight combinations that the columns of the basis matrix can receive for a given source signal . In the separation stage the prior GMMs are used to guide the NMF solution of the gains weights matrices using MMSE estimation . The NMF decomposition weights matrix is treated as a distorted image by a distortion operator which is learned directly from the observed signals . The MMSE estimate of the weights matrix under the trained GMM prior and log normal distribution for the distortion is then found to improve the NMF decomposition results . The MMSE estimate is embedded within the optimization objective to form a novel regularized NMF cost function . The corresponding update rules for the new objectives are derived in this paper . The proposed MMSE estimates based regularization avoids the problem of computing the hyper parameters and the regularization parameters . MMSE also provides a better estimate for the valid gains matrix . Experimental results show that the proposed regularized NMF algorithm improves the source separation performance compared with using NMF without a prior or with other prior models . \\n'],\n",

In this paper we discuss the evolution of computer based object recognition systems over the last fifty years and overview the successes and failures of proposed solutions to the problem . We survey the breadth of approaches adopted over the years in attempting to solve the problem and highlight the important role that active and attentive approaches must play in any solution that bridges the semantic gap in the proposed object representations while simultaneously leading to efficient learning and inference algorithms . From the earliest systems which dealt with the character recognition problem to modern visually guided agents that can purposively search entire rooms for objects we argue that a common thread of all such systems is their fragility and their inability to generalize as well as the human visual system can . At the same time however we demonstrate that the performance of such systems in strictly controlled environments often vastly outperforms the capabilities of the human visual system . We conclude our survey by arguing that the next step in the evolution of object recognition algorithms will require radical and bold steps forward in terms of the object representations as well as the learning and inference algorithms used . \\n'],\n",

Large video databases like YouTube require that a user uploading a new video assign to it a category label from a prescribed set of labels . Such category labeling is likely to be corrupted by the subjective biases of the uploader . Despite their noisy nature these subjective labels are frequently used as gold standard in algorithms for multimedia classification and retrieval . Our goal in this paper is NOT to propose yet another algorithm that predicts labels for unseen videos based on the subjective ground truth . On the other hand our goal is to demonstrate that the video classification performance can be improved if instead of using subjective labels we first create an objectively labeled ground truth set of videos and then train a classifier based on such a ground truth so as to predict objective labels for the set of unlabeled videos . With regard to how we generate the objectively labeled ground truth dataset we base it on the notion that when a video is labeled by a panel of diverse individuals the majority opinion rendered by the panel may be taken to be the objective opinion . In this manner using judgments provided by multiple human annotators we have collected objective labels for a ground truth dataset consisting of randomly selected 1000 videos from the TinyVideos database that contains roughly 52 000 videos from YouTube . Through a fourfold cross validation experiment on the ground truth set we demonstrate that the objective labels have a superior consistency compared to the subjective labels when used for video classification . We show that this claim is valid for several different kinds of feature sets that one can use to compare videos and with two different types of classifiers that one can use for label prediction . Subsequently we use the ground truth dataset of 1000 videos to predict the objective category labels of the remaining 51 000 videos .

The classification of each point match relies on the histogram of a quantity representing the difference between cross ratios derived from a construction involving 6 tuples of point matches . Neither constraints nor scenario dependent parameters thresholds are needed . Even for few candidate point matches the ensemble of 6 tuples containing each of them turns to provide statistically reliable histograms that prove to discriminate between inliers and outliers . In fact in most cases a random sampling among this population is sufficient . Nevertheless the accuracy of the method is positively correlated to its sampling density leading to an accuracy versus resulting computational complexity trade off . Theoretical analysis and experiments are given that show the consistent performance of the proposed classification method when applied in inlier outlier discrimination .

This is an operator which maps the semantic descriptors of images labeled with that concept to the descriptors of the associated texts . A convex formulation of the learning problem is introduced enabling the efficient computation of concept specific regularization operators . The third step is the selection of the most suitable operator for the image to regularize . This is implemented through a quantization of the semantic space where a regularization operator is associated with each quantization cell . Overall the proposed regularizer is a non linear mapping implemented as a piecewise linear transformation of the semantic image descriptors to regularize .

However such models are difficult to maintain accurately and efficiently . In this paper we observe that hashing techniques can be used to represent object by compact binary code which is efficient for processing . However during tracking online updating hash functions is still inefficient with large number of samples . To deal with this bottleneck a novel hashing method called two dimensional hashing is proposed . In our tracker samples and templates are hashed to binary matrices and the hamming distance is used to measure confidence of candidate samples .

We represent appearance as distributions of low level fine grained image features . Multiview models encode the appearance of objects at discrete viewpoints and in addition how these viewpoints deform into one another as the viewpoint continuously varies . Using a measure of similarity between an arbitrary test image and such a model at chosen viewpoints we perform all tasks mentioned above with a common method . We leverage the simplicity of low level image features such as points extracted along edges or coarse scale gradients extracted densely over the images by building probabilistic templates i.e . distributions of features learned from one or several training examples . We efficiently handle these distributions with probabilistic techniques such as kernel density estimation Monte Carlo integration and importance sampling . We provide an extensive evaluation on a wide variety of benchmark datasets . We demonstrate performance on the ETHZ Shape dataset with single and multiple training examples well above baseline methods on par with a number of more task specific methods . We obtain remarkable performance on the recognition of more complex objects notably the cars of the 3D Object dataset of Savarese et al . with detection rates of 92.5 and an accuracy in pose estimation of 91 . We perform better than the state of the art on continuous pose estimation with the rotating cars dataset of Ozuysal et al . We also demonstrate particular capabilities with a novel dataset featuring non textured objects of undistinctive shapes the pose of which can only be determined from shading captured here by coarse scale intensity gradients . This paper is concerned with the joint recognition and pose estimation of object categories in 2D images . Recognizing that these two tasks represent two sides of a same problem we tackle them in a unified approach . In general the pose of objects can not be inferred from just one type of image information e.g . silhouette and edges to cite a common example . Additional visual cues may be necessary such as the shading onto the object surface .

Unfortunately more often than not decision boundaries derived in this manner do not extrapolate well from one image to another . This happens for several reasons most having to do with the fact that different satellite images correspond to different view angles on the earth s surface different sun angles different seasons and so on . In this paper we get around these limitations of the current state of the art by first proposing a new integrated representation for all of the images overlapping and non overlapping that cover a large geographic ROI . In addition to helping understand the data variability in the images this representation also makes it possible to create the ground truth that can be used for ROI based wide area learning of the classifiers . We use this integrated representation in a new Bayesian framework for data classification that is characterized by learning of the decision boundaries from a sampling of all the satellite data available for an entire geographic ROI probabilistic modeling of within class and between class variations as opposed to the more traditional probabilistic modeling of the feature vectors extracted from the measurement data and using variance based ML and MAP classifiers whose decision boundary calculations incorporate all of the multi view data for a geographic point if that point is selected for learning and testing . We show results with the new classification framework for an ROI in Chile whose size is roughly 10 000 square kilometers . This ROI is covered by 189 satellite images with varying degrees of overlap . We compare the classification performance of the proposed ROI based framework with the results obtained by extrapolating the decision boundaries learned from a single image to the entire ROI .

Furthermore due to manual modeling and calibration processes their application is often time consuming . Current application of 2D thermography for building diagnostics is also facing several challenges due to a large number of unordered and non geo tagged images . To address these limitations this paper presents a new computer vision based method for automated 3D energy performance modeling of existing buildings using thermal and digital imagery captured by a single thermal camera . First using a new image based 3D reconstruction pipeline which consists of Graphic Processing Unit based Structure from Motion and Multi View Stereo algorithms the geometrical conditions of an existing building is reconstructed in 3D . Next a 3D thermal point cloud model of the building is generated by using a new 3D thermal modeling algorithm . This algorithm involves a one time thermal camera calibration deriving the relative transformation by forming the Epipolar geometry between thermal and digital images and the MVS algorithm for dense reconstruction . By automatically superimposing the 3D building and thermal point cloud models 3D spatio thermal models are formed which enable the users to visualize query and analyze temperatures at the level of 3D points . The underlying algorithms for generating and visualizing the 3D spatio thermal models and the 3D registered digital and thermal images are presented in detail . The proposed method is validated for several interior and exterior locations of a typical residential building and an instructional facility .

These experts normally have their own domain specific designing methods and tools which can lead to incompatibilities when one needs to work together using these those methods and tools . Having a proper framework which integrates different design tools is of interest as such a framework can prevent incompatibilities between parts during the design process . In this paper we propose our co modelling methodology and co simulation tools integration framework which helps to maintain the domain specific properties of the model components during the co design process of various mechatronic devices . To avoid expensive rework later in the design phase and even possible system failure fault modelling and a layered structure with fault tolerance mechanisms for the controller software are introduced . In the end a practical mechatronic device is discussed to illustrate the methods and tools which are presented in this paper in details . \\n'],\n",

The review considers how models compare across domains of application the degree to which current models are fit for purpose how to choose between multiple alternative formulations and how models might be improved. Lake and marine models have been gradually increasing in complexity with increasing emphasis on inorganic processes and ecosystems. River models have remained simpler but have been more rigorously assessed. Processes important in less eutrophic systems have often been neglected these include the biogeochemistry of organic phosphorus transformations associated with fluxes through soils and sediments transfer rate limited phosphorus uptake and responses of plants to pulsed nutrient inputs.

The formal processes used in the legal e discovery research include a LexisNexis search strategy to collect legal documents text mining to find key concepts and their representing key phrases in the documents clustering algorithms to associate the legal cases into groups and concept lattice analysis to trace the evolutionary trends of the main groups . The case analysis discovers the fundamental issues for retail modernization advantages and disadvantages of retail franchising systems and the potential litigation hazards to be avoided in the Australian market . Given the growing number of legal documents in global court systems this research provides a systematic and generalized CLI methodology to improve the efficiency and efficacy of research across international legal systems . In the context of the case study the results demonstrate the critical importance of quickly processing and interpreting existing legal knowledge using the CLI approach . For example a brand management company which purchases a successful franchise in one market is under limited time constraints to evaluate the legal environment across global markets of interest . The proposed CLI methodology can be applied to derive market entry strategies to secure growth and brand expansion of a global franchise . \\n'],\n",

After a short molecular dynamics simulation a variety of interaction energies and structural parameters were extracted . Linear regression was performed to determine which of these parameters have a potentially significant contribution to the protein ligand interaction . The parameters exhibiting relatively high correlation coefficients were selected . Important factors seem to be the number of ligand atoms the ratio of N O and S atoms to total ligand atoms the hydrophobic polar aminoacid ratio and the ratio of cavity size to the sum of ligand plus water atoms in the cavity . An important factor also seems to be the immobile water molecules in the cavity . Nine of these parameters were used as known inputs to train a neural network in the prediction of seven other . Eight structures were left out of the training to test the quality of the predictions . After optimization of the neural network the predictions were fairly accurate given the relatively small number of structures especially in the prediction of the number of nitrogen and sulfur atoms of the ligand . \\n'],\n",

As catenin dependent transcriptional repression and activation events involve binding of Reptin and histone deacetylase 1 to APPL endocytic proteins this complex has become an important target to identify molecules governing endocytic processes and WNT signalling . Here we describe the structural basis of APPL binding to Reptin to explore their mode of binding in context with APPL1 APPL2 dimerization . There is an evidence that both PH and BAR domains of APPL proteins exhibit alternately conserved regions involved in hetero dimerization process and our in silico data also corroborate this fact . Moreover APPL2PH domain binds to the BAR domain region encompassing a nuclear localization signal . We conclude that APPLPH binding to BAR domain and Reptin is mutually exclusive which regulates the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Reptin . Furthermore Reptin is unable to bind with membrane associated APPL proteins . These observations were further expanded by experimental approaches where we identified a novel point mutation D316N lying in the APPL1PH domain which resulted in a significantly reduced binding with Reptin . By luciferase assays we observed that overexpression of APPL1D316N and APPL1WT stimulated catenin TCF dependent transcriptional activity in a similar manner which suggested that binding of Reptin to APPL1 is not necessary for catenin dependent target gene expression . Overall our data attempt to highlight a comparative role of APPL proteins in controlling catenin dependent transcription mechanism which may improve our understanding of gene regulation . \\n'],\n",

This fact combined with the ongoing threat of using B. anthracis as a biological weapon proves that the identification of new therapeutic targets is urgently needed . Methods In this computational approach various databases and online based servers were used to detect essential proteins of B. anthracis A0248 . Protein sequences of B. anthracis A0248 strain were retrieved from the NCBI database which was then run in CD hit suite for clustering . NCBI BlastP against the human proteome and similarity search against DEG were done to find out essential human non homologous proteins . Proteins involved in unique pathways were analyzed using KEGG genome database and PSORTb CELLO v.2.5 ngLOC these three tools were used to deduce putative cell surface proteins . Results Successive analysis revealed 116 proteins to be essential human non homologs among which 17 were involved in unique metabolic pathways and 28 were predicted as membrane associated proteins . Both types of proteins can be exploited as they are unlikely to have homologous counterparts in the human host .

The degree of homology of the almond 12kDa protein with any other known 2S albumin appears to be much lower than the one reported in the paper that firstly described it . In a publicly available cDNA library we discovered an expressed sequence tag which translation generates a protein that perfectly matches both of the sequencing outputs described in the same paper . A further analysis indicated that the latter protein seems to belong to the vicilin superfamily rather than to the prolamin one . The fact that also vicilins are seed storage proteins known to be highly allergenic would explain the IgE reactivity originally observed .

Despite available experimental results molecular mechanisms of action of inhalants and organic solvents such as acetone on lipid membranes remain not well understood . To gain a better understanding of how acetone interacts with membranes we have performed a series of molecular dynamics simulations of a POPC bilayer in aqueous solution in the presence of acetone whose concentration was varied from 2.8 to 11.2mol . The MD simulations of passive distribution of acetone between a bulk water phase and a lipid bilayer show that acetone favors partitioning into the water free region of the bilayer located near the carbonyl groups of the phospholipids and at the beginning of the hydrocarbon core of the lipid membrane . Using MD umbrella sampling we found that the permeability barrier of 0.5kcal mol exists for acetone partitioning into the membrane . In addition a Gibbs free energy profile of the acetone penetration across a bilayer demonstrates a favorable potential energy well of 3.6kcal mol located at 15 16 from the bilayer center . The analysis of the structural and dynamics properties of the model membrane revealed that the POPC bilayer can tolerate the presence of acetone in the concentration range of 2.8 5.6mol . The accumulation of the higher acetone concentration of 11.2mol results however in drastic disordering of phospholipid packing and the increase in the membrane fluidity . The acetone molecules push the lipid heads apart and hence act as spacers in the headgroup region . This effect leads to the increase in the average headgroup area per molecule . In addition the acyl tail region of the membrane also becomes less dense . We suggest therefore that the molecular mechanism of acetone action on the phospholipid bilayer has many common features with the effects of short chain alcohols DMSO and chloroform . \\n'],\n",

Principles are encoded as constraints which become formulas of a two layer graded hybrid logic where the upper layer restricts reconfigurations and the lower layer constrains the resulting configurations . Constraints are verified by translating them into logic formulas which are interpreted over models derived from Archery specifications of architectures and reconfigurations . Suitable notions of bisimulation and refinement to which the architect may resort to compare configurations are given and their relationship with modal validity is discussed . \\n'],\n",
              " [' Given a set of symmetric antisymmetric filter vectors containing only regular multiresolution filters the method we present in this article can establish a balanced multiresolution scheme for images allowing their balanced decomposition and subsequent perfect reconstruction without the use of any extraordinary boundary filters . We define balanced multiresolution such that it allows balanced decomposition i.e . decomposition of a high resolution image into a low resolution image and corresponding details of equal size . Such a balanced decomposition makes on demand reconstruction of regions of interest efficient in both computational load and implementation aspects . We find this balanced decomposition and perfect reconstruction based on an appropriate combination of symmetric antisymmetric extensions near the image and detail boundaries . In our method exploiting such extensions correlates to performing sample split operations . Our general approach is demonstrated for some commonly used symmetric antisymmetric multiresolution filters . We also show the application of such a balanced multiresolution scheme in real time focus context visualization . \\n'],\n",

A major barrier has been a lack of understanding by system designers of communicable disease work and the public health workers who perform this work . This study reports on the application of user centered design representations traditionally used for improving interface design to translate the complex CD work identified through ethnographic studies to guide designers and developers of CD systems . The purpose of this work is to better understand public health practitioners and their information workflow with respect to CD monitoring and control at a local health agency and to develop evidence based design representations that model this CD work to inform the design of future disease surveillance systems . Methods We performed extensive onsite semi structured interviews targeted work shadowing and a focus group to characterize local health agency CD workflow . Informed by principles of design ethnography and user centered design we created persona scenarios and user stories to accurately represent the user to system designers . Results We sought to convey to designers the key findings from ethnographic studies public health CD work is mobile and episodic in contrast to current CD reporting systems which are stationary and fixed health agency efforts are focused on CD investigation and response rather than reporting and current CD information systems must conform to public health workflow to ensure their usefulness . In an effort to illustrate our findings to designers we developed three contemporary design support representations persona scenario and user story . Conclusions Through application of user centered design principles we were able to create design representations that illustrate complex public health communicable disease workflow and key user characteristics to inform the design of CD information systems for public health . \\n'],\n",

We comparatively evaluate the usability of these two input modes in a telecardiology system for issuing electrocardiography reports in the context of a statewide telemedicine system in Brazil with more than 350.000 performed tele electrocardiography examinations . We adopted a multiple method research strategy applying three different kinds of usability evaluations user satisfaction was evaluated through interviews with seven medical professionals using the System Usability Scale questionnaire and specific questions related to adequacy and user experience . Efficiency was evaluated by estimating execution time using the Keystroke Level Model . General usability was assessed based on the conformity of the systems to a set of e health specific usability heuristics . The results of this comparison provide a first indication that a structured report input mode for such a system is more satisfactory and efficient with a larger conformity to usability heuristics than free text input . User satisfaction using the SUS questionnaire has been scored in average with 58.8 and 77.5 points for the FT and SR system respectively which means that the SR system was rated 18.65 points higher than the FT system . In terms of efficiency the completion of a findings report using the SR mode is estimated to take 8.5s 3.74 times faster than using the FT system . The SR system also demonstrated less violations to usability heuristics in comparison to 14 points observed in the FT system .

This study undertakes an exhaustive approach to fully delimit the dimensional structure related to the utilitarian motivations for online consumption . First an in depth literature review is carried out in order to allow the proposal of an aprioristic base structure of eleven categories of utilitarian motivations . Next qualitative analyses are applied to assess and eventually refine the structure of utilitarian motivations proposed after the literature review their labels and respective measurement scales . Finally this qualitative phase concludes with ten motivational categories and 46 items . Then quantitative analyses are applied based on a questionnaire administered to a sample of 667 Internet users to keep refining and to eventually validate both the dimensional structure of motivations and the related measurement scales . Finally a structure of 9 utilitarian motivations is established with the following labels assortment economy convenience availability of information adaptability customization desire for control payment services anonymity and absence of social interaction . The nomological validity of this structure is satisfactorily tested using a second order factor model . The article finishes by discussing some implications for practitioners . \\n'],\n",

We developed and evaluated a rule based natural language processing system to extract mammographic findings from free text mammography reports . Materials and Methods The NLP system extracted four mammographic findings mass calcification asymmetry and architectural distortion using a dictionary look up method on 93 705 mammography reports from Group Health . Status annotations and anatomical location annotation were associated to each NLP detected finding through association rules . After excluding negated uncertain and historical findings affirmative mentions of detected findings were summarized . Confidence flags were developed to denote reports with highly confident NLP results and reports with possible NLP errors . A random sample of 100 reports was manually abstracted to evaluate the accuracy of the system . Results The NLP system correctly coded 96 99 out of our sample of 100 reports depending on findings . Measures of sensitivity specificity and negative predictive values exceeded 0.92 for all findings . Positive predictive values were relatively low for some findings due to their low prevalence . Discussion Our NLP system was implemented entirely in SAS Base which makes it portable and easy to implement . It performed reasonably well with multiple applications such as using confidence flags as a filter to improve the efficiency of manual review . Refinements of library and association rules and testing on more diverse samples may further improve its performance .

Although the copyright holders of TV content claimed that Betamax was an infringement of copyright the court determined that the benefits of personal recording services were significant and that the copyright holder s profits could be protected because the original service was of better quality and had a better cost structure . It also ruled that the loss from manual advertisement skip was minimal . However recent advancements in information technology have allowed new kinds of personal recording services such as a cloud DVR that provides unlimited storage and flawless quality and an Auto hop feature that automatically removes embedded advertisements .

In this study we report on the creation of an annotated corpus of Swedish health records for the purpose of learning to identify information pertaining to ADEs present in clinical notes . To this end three key tasks are tackled recognizing relevant named entities labeling attributes of the recognized entities and relationships between them . For each of the three tasks leveraging models of distributional semantics i.e . unsupervised methods that exploit co occurrence information to model typically in vector space the meaning of words and in particular combinations of such models is shown to improve the predictive performance .

Simply an ad option is a first look contract in which a publisher or search engine grants an advertiser a right but not obligation to enter into transactions to purchase impressions or clicks from a specific ad slot at a pre specified price on a specific delivery date . Such a structure provides advertisers with more flexibility of their guaranteed deliveries . The valuation of ad options is an important topic and previous studies on ad options pricing have been mostly restricted to the situations where the underlying prices follow a geometric Brownian motion . This assumption is reasonable for sponsored search however some studies have also indicated that it is not valid for display advertising . In this paper we address this issue by employing a stochastic volatility model and discuss a lattice framework to approximate the proposed SV model in option pricing . Our developments are validated by experiments with real advertising data we find that the SV model has a better fitness over the GBM model we validate the proposed lattice model via two sequential Monte Carlo simulation methods we demonstrate that advertisers are able to flexibly manage their guaranteed deliveries by using the proposed options and publishers can have an increased revenue when some of their inventories are sold via ad options . \\n'],\n",

Its importance has been dramatically increasing recently due to the enormous increase in new drug discovery cost . However most of the previous molecular centered drug repositioning work is not able to reflect the end point physiological activities of drugs because of the inherent complexity of human physiological systems . Methods Here we suggest a novel computational framework to make inferences for alternative indications of marketed drugs by using electronic clinical information which reflects the end point physiological results of drug s effects on the biological activities of humans . In this work we use the concept of complementarity between clinical disease signatures and clinical drug effects . With this framework we establish disease related clinical variable vectors and drug related clinical variable vectors by applying two methodologies . Finally we assign a repositioning possibility score to each disease drug pair by the calculation of complementarity and association between clinical states of disease signatures and clinical effects of drugs . A total of 717 clinical variables in the electronic clinical dataset are considered in this study . Results The statistical significance of our prediction results is supported through two benchmark datasets . We discovered not only lots of known relationships between diseases and drugs but also many hidden disease drug relationships . For example glutathione and edetic acid may be investigated as candidate drugs for asthma treatment . We examined prediction results by using statistical experiments and presented evidences for those with already published literature . Conclusion The results show that electronic clinical information is a feasible data resource and utilizing the complementarity between clinical signatures of disease and clinical effects of drugs is a potentially predictive concept in drug repositioning research . It makes the proposed approach useful to identity novel relationships between diseases and drugs that have a high probability of being biologically valid . \\n'],\n",

Improved radiology education could potentially contribute to alleviating this issue . Toward this goal in this paper we propose an algorithm for modeling of false positive error making among radiology trainees . Identifying troublesome locations for the trainees could focus their training and in turn improve their performance . Methods The algorithm proposed in this paper predicts locations that are likely to result in a false positive error for each trainee based on the previous annotations made by the trainee . The algorithm consists of three steps . First the suspicious false positive locations are identified in mammograms by Difference of Gaussian filter and suspicious regions are segmented by computer vision based segmentation algorithms . Second 133 features are extracted for each suspicious region to describe its distinctive characteristics . Third a random forest classifier is applied to predict the likelihood of the trainee making a false positive error using the extracted features . The random forest classifier is trained using previous annotations made by the trainee . We evaluated the algorithm using data from a reader study in which 3 experts and 10 trainees interpreted 100 mammographic cases . Results The algorithm was able to identify locations where the trainee will commit a false positive error with accuracy higher than an algorithm that selects such locations randomly . Specifically our algorithm found false positive locations with 40 accuracy when only 1 location was selected for all cases for each trainee and 12 accuracy when 10 locations were selected . The accuracies for randomly identified locations were both 0 for these two scenarios . Conclusions In this first study on the topic we were able to build computer models that were able to find locations for which a trainee will make a false positive error in images that were not previously seen by the trainee . Presenting the trainees with such locations rather than randomly selected ones may improve their educational outcomes . \\n'],\n",

Compared to the curves formed from a linear function symmetric saturating linear function and hyperbolic tangent function the stress signal produced by the stress signal predictor for the observers was the most similar to the curve formed by a hyperbolic tangent function with p 0.01 according to statistical analysis .

Fuzzy and random fuzzy constraints have been defuzzified using possibility and possibility probability chance constraint techniques . The fuzzy objective function also has been defuzzified using possibility chance constraint against a goal . Both deterministic optimization problems are formulated for maximization of profit and solved using genetic algorithm and fuzzy simulation based genetic algorithm . The models are illustrated with some numerical data . Results for different achievement levels are obtained and sensitivity analysis on expected profit function is also presented . Scope and purpose The traditional inventory model considers the ideal case in which depletion of inventory is caused by a constant demand rate . However for more sale inventory should be maintained at a higher level . Of course this would result in higher holding or procurement cost etc . Also in many real situations during a shortage period the longer the waiting time is the smaller the backlogging rate would be . For instance for fashionable commodities and high tech products with short product life cycle the willingness for a customer to wait for backlogging diminishes with the length of the waiting time . Most of the classical inventory models did not take into account the effects of inflation and time value of money . But at present the economic situation of most of the countries has been much deteriorated due to large scale inflation and consequent sharp decline in the purchasing power of money . So it has not been possible to ignore the effects of inflation and time value of money any further .

              " [' A new disturbance detection and classification technique based on modified Adaline and adaptive neuro fuzzy information system is proposed for a distributed generation system comprising a wind power generating system and a photovoltaic array . The proposed technique is based on a fast Gauss Newton parameter updating rule rather than the conventional Widrow Hoff delta rule for the Adaline network . The voltage and current signals near the target distributed generation particularly the DFIG whose speed varies from minimum to the maximum cut off speed are processed through the modified Adaline network to yield the features like the negative sequence power harmonic amplification factor total harmonic distortion etc . These features are then used as training sets for the ANFIS which employs a gradient descent algorithm to update its parameters . The proposed technique distinguishes the islanding condition of the distributed generation system with some other disturbances such as switching faults capacitor bank switching voltage swell voltage sag distorted grid voltage unbalanced load switching etc . which are referred to as non islanding cases in this paper . \\n'],\n",

The tuned models were especially found to generalize better and to be more robust compared to other optimization approaches . However the advantages of the tuning often came along with high computation times meaning a real burden for employing tuning algorithms . While the training with a reduced number of patterns can be a solution to this it is often connected with decreasing model accuracies and increasing instabilities and noise . Hence we propose a novel approach defined by a two criteria optimization task where both the runtime and the quality of ML models are optimized . Because the budgets for this optimization task are usually very restricted in ML the surrogate assisted Efficient Global Optimization algorithm is adapted . In order to cope with noisy experiments we apply two hypervolume indicator based EGO algorithms with smoothing and re interpolation of the surrogate models . The techniques do not need replicates . We find that these EGO techniques can outperform traditional approaches such as latin hypercube sampling as well as EGO variants with replicates . \\n'],\n",

In order to overcome these drawbacks computer based automated embolic detection systems which employ spectral properties of emboli speckle and artifact using Fourier and Wavelet Transforms have been proposed . In this study we propose a fast accurate and robust automated emboli detection system based on the Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform . Employing the DTCWT which does not suffer from the lack of shift invariance property of ordinary Discrete Wavelet Transform increases the robustness of the coefficients extracted from the Doppler ultrasound signals . In this study a Doppler ultrasound dataset including 100 samples from each embolic Doppler speckle and artifact signal is used . Each sample obtained from forward and reverse blood flow directions is represented by 1024 points . In our method we first extract the forward and reverse blood flow coefficients separately using DTCWT from the samples . Then dimensionality reduction is applied to each set of coefficients and both of the reduced set of coefficients are fed to classifiers individually . Subsequently in the view that the forward and reverse blood flow coefficients carry different characteristics the individual predictors of these classifiers are combined using ensemble stacking method . We compare the obtained results with Fast Fourier Transform and DWT based emboli detection systems and show that the features extracted using DTCWT give the highest accuracy and emboli detection rate .

Inspired by observations in the neuroscience literature the input layer employs a new neuron model which converts real valued stimuli into spikes with varying amplitudes and firing times . The intermediate layer neurons are modeled as integrate and fire spiking neurons . The decision block identifies that intermediate neuron which fires first and returns the class label associated with that neuron as the predicted class label . The sequential learning algorithm for the spiking neural network automatically determines the network structure from the training samples and adapts its synaptic weights by long term potentiation and long term depression . Performance of SLSNC has been evaluated using a number of benchmark classification problems and the results have been compared with other well known spiking neural network classifiers in the literature as well as with the standard support vector machine with a Gaussian kernel and the fast learning Extreme Learning Machine classifiers .

              " [' The main aim in network anomaly detection is effectively spotting hostile events within the traffic pattern associated to network operations by distinguishing them from normal activities . This can be only accomplished by acquiring the a priori knowledge about any kind of hostile behavior that can potentially affect the network or more easily by building a model that is general enough to describe the normal network behavior and detect the violations from it . Earlier detection frameworks were only able to distinguish already known phenomena within traffic data by using pre trained models based on matching specific events on pre classified chains of traffic patterns . Alternatively more recent statistics based approaches were able to detect outliers respect to a statistic idealization of normal network behavior . Clearly while the former approach is not able to detect previously unknown phenomena the latter one has limited effectiveness since it can not be aware of anomalous behaviors that do not generate significant changes in traffic volumes . Machine learning allows the development of adaptive non parametric detection strategies that are based on understanding the network dynamics by acquiring through a proper training phase a more precise knowledge about normal or anomalous phenomena in order to classify and handle in a more effective way any kind of behavior that can be observed on the network . Accordingly we present a new anomaly detection strategy based on supervised machine learning and more precisely on a batch relevance based fuzzyfied learning algorithm known as U BRAIN aiming at understanding through inductive inference the specific laws and rules governing normal or abnormal network traffic in order to reliably model its operating dynamics . The inferred rules can be applied in real time on online network traffic .

Considering this the proposed approach was initially evaluated for signals originating from mathematical models representing short term voltage fluctuations transients and harmonic distortions .

Based on these calculations a unique adaptive threshold could be determined for each analyzed signal . Afterwards the amount of existing intersections between the threshold and the curve of details obtained for the second level of decomposition was then defined .

Unfortunately the large quantities of opinions make it difficult for an individual to comprehend and evaluate them all in a reasonable amount of time . The users have to read a large number of opinions of different entities before making any decision . Recently a new retrieval task in information retrieval known as Opinion Based Entity Ranking has emerged . OpER directly ranks relevant entities based on how well opinions on them are matched with a user s preferences that are given in the form of queries . With such a capability users do not need to read a large number of opinions available for the entities . Previous research on OpER does not take into account the importance and subjectivity of query keywords in individual opinions of an entity . Entity relevance scores are computed primarily on the basis of occurrences of query keywords match by assuming all opinions of an entity as a single field of text . Intuitively entities that have positive judgments and strong relevance with query keywords should be ranked higher than those entities that have poor relevance and negative judgments . This paper outlines several ranking features and develops an intuitive framework for OpER in which entities are ranked according to how well individual opinions of entities are matched with the user s query keywords . As a useful ranking model may be constructed from many ranking features we apply learning to rank approach based on genetic programming to combine features in order to develop an effective retrieval model for OpER task . The proposed approach is evaluated on two collections and is found to be significantly more effective than the standard OpER approach . \\n'],\n",

Recordings were obtained at rest . Many patients from the latter group presented normal ECGs thus the hypothesis to prove was that electrical axis in any of the studied planes would effectively discriminate silent ischemia records from healthy ones . The FP was constructed with I and aVF leads while the PP used the two first eigenvectors of the spatial correlation matrix of the ECG . Although the depolarization and repolarization vectors from both groups resulted normal those from the silent ischemia group appeared strongly biased to the left closer to the limit of the normality range . This slight change originated a significant separation between health and disease in the FP . Here most of the parameters resulted highly informative even those related to the depolarization phase . The cardiac vector integrating both depolarization and repolarization information presented the highest performance . Parameters in the PP however did not produce an acceptable discrimination except for the amplitude of the T wave . Additionally the repolarization orientation in the FP was the only marker that simultaneously discriminated three different groups of patients according to their occlusion sites . In conclusion the FP offered a 2D representation general enough to enable the separation of silent ischemia versus health populations while the PP did not due mainly to its individually optimized nature failing to provide a unique referencial frame for all the subjects . \\n'],\n",

Using independent component analysis the EEG is separated into independent components and the contaminated component is removed thus removing the OA . However ICA does not separate the sources completely and some of the meaningful EEG is lost . In this paper a new method combining ICA and wavelet neural networking is proposed . In this method WNN is applied to the contaminated ICs correcting the OA and thus lowering the data lost . The method was evaluated using simulated and real datasets and the results show that the OA are successfully removed with very little data loss . \\n'],\n",

To calculate these markers it is necessary to determine the location of the onset and systolic peak of the arterial pulse wave . In this paper a method employed for electrocardiography R peak detection with a slight modification is applied for both the onset and systolic peak detections in APW . The method employs Shannon energy envelope estimator Hilbert transform and moving average filter . The minimum value and the positive zero crossing points of the odd symmetry function of the HT correspond to the locations of the onset and systolic peak respectively . The algorithm was evaluated using expert s annotations with 10 records of 5min length and different signal to noise ratios and achieved a good performance and precision . When compared to expert s annotation the algorithm detected these fiducial points with average sensitivity positive predictivity and accuracy of 100 and presented errors less than 10ms . In APW signals contaminated with noise in both cases the relative error is less than 2 respect to pulse wave periods of 800ms . The performance of algorithm was compared with both foot approximation and adaptive threshold methods and the results show that the algorithm outperforms theses reported methods with respect to manuals annotation . The results are promising suggesting that the method provides a simple but accurate onset and systolic peak detection and can be used in the measurement of pulse transit time pulse wave velocity and pulse rate variability . \\n'],\n",

The widely commonly used unsupervised Principal Component Analysis approach was compared to the promising supervised common spatial pattern methodology to identify the best classification strategy and the related tuning parameters . A low density array of sEMG sensors was built to record the muscular activity of the forearm and classify five different hand gestures . Twenty healthy subjects were recruited to compute optimized parameters for and to compare between the two strategies . The system was also tested on a transradial amputee subject in order to assess the robustness of the optimization in recognizing disabled users gestures . Results show that RMS WA ANN is the best feature vector classifier pair for the PCA approach whereas M RMS WA ANN is the best pair for the CSP methodology . Statistical analysis on classification results shows no significant differences between the two strategies . Moreover we found out that the optimization computed for healthy subjects was proven to be sufficiently robust to be used on the amputee subject . This motivates further investigation of the proposed methodology on a larger sample of amputees . Our results are useful to boost EMG based hand gesture recognition and constitute a step toward the definition of an efficient EMG controlled system for amputees . \\n'],\n",

Then the compression scheme is composed of two parts the ICs compression part and the residue compression part . Each IC is arranged in the form of matrix and then compressed with the algorithm of set partitioning in hierarchical trees . The residue signals are compressed in the same way as ICs but with a higher compression ratio .

However MFCC does not consider both the relationship among neighbor coefficients of Mel filters of a frame and the relationship among coefficients of Mel filters of neighbor frames which possibly leads to lose many useful features from spectrogram . This paper presents novel weighted spectral features based on Local Hu moments . The idea is motivated by that the energy on spectrogram would drastically vary with some emotion types such as angry and happy while it would slightly change with other emotion types such as sadness and fear . This phenomenon would affect the local energy distribution of spectrogram in both time axis and frequency axis of spectrogram . To describe local energy distribution of spectrogram Hu moments computed from local regions of spectrogram are used as Hu moments can evaluate the degree how the energy is concentrated to the center of energy gravity of local region of spectrogram and can significantly vary with the speech emotion types . The conducted experiments validate the proposed features in terms of the effectiveness of the speech emotion recognition . \\n'],\n",

While the evoked response is given by peaks and troughs in the signal time locked and phase locked to the stimuli the induced response is time but not phase locked and can be considered as an increase or a decrease in the power of EEG in a specific frequency band at a specific time range with regard to the stimulus onset . The induced response does not have the same phase following successive stimuli . It is believed that cognition and perception of a stimulus present themselves primarily as the induced response in the EEG . In this paper the induced response of the brain to auditory speech stimuli is investigated and different approaches to detect induced activity are compared . It is shown that there is an increase in theta and delta power in response to words compared to the baseline starting around 500ms after their onset . During this time there is also an increase in pairwise coherence between the posterior electrodes . In response to tone bursts a change in pairwise coherence was observed in the beta band starting around 200ms . To the best of our knowledge this is the first time such responses have been described using simple protocols without complex stimulus manipulations being involved . Responses in the EEG to speech rather than the more conventional tone bursts or clicks suggests that it may be feasible to use the EEG as an objective means to demonstrate brain activation to salient real world stimuli . This would be of particular benefit in investigating access to speech in patients who are unable or unwilling to reliably respond to conventional subjective experimental protocols such as infants . \\n'],\n",

A system that could monitor and eventually predict these changes would be useful to improve therapy and avoid dangerous events . Speech might convey relevant information about subjects mood and there is a growing interest to study its changes in presence of mood disorders . In this work we present an automatic method to characterize fundamental frequency dynamics in voiced part of syllables . The method performs a segmentation of voiced sounds from running speech samples and estimates two categories of features . The first category is borrowed from Taylor s Tilt intonational model . However the meaning of the proposed features is different from the meaning of Taylor s ones since the former are estimated from all voiced segments without performing any analysis of intonation . A second category of features takes into account the speed of change of F0 . In this work the proposed features are first estimated from an emotional speech database . Then an analysis on speech samples acquired from eleven psychiatric patients experiencing different mood states and eighteen healthy control subjects is introduced . Subjects had to perform a text reading task and a picture commenting task . The results of the analysis on the emotional speech database indicate that the proposed features can discriminate between high and low arousal emotions . This was verified both at single subject and group level . An intra subject analysis was performed on bipolar patients and it highlighted significant changes of the features with different mood states although this was not observed for all the subjects . The directions of the changes estimated for different patients experiencing the same mood swing were not coherent and were task dependent . Interestingly a single subject analysis performed on healthy controls and on bipolar patients recorded twice with the same mood label resulted in a very small number of significant differences . In particular a very good specificity was highlighted for the Taylor inspired features and for a subset of the second category of features thus strengthening the significance of the results obtained with patients . Even if the number of enrolled patients is small this work suggests that the proposed features might give a relevant contribution to the demanding research field of speech based mood classifiers . Moreover the results here presented indicate that a model of speech changes in bipolar patients might be subject specific and that a richer characterization of subject status could be necessary to explain the observed variability . \\n'],\n",

In a computational simulation with known clock frequencies the results show a synchronization error of 1 10 of the time resolution for both methods .

This work aims to improve the performance and bedside utility of the minimal recruitment model through simplifying the model and improving the identification algorithm without compromising the model s physiological relevance to the disease . Identifying the model requires fitting of 8 unique parameters to pressure volume data at multiple levels of positive end expiratory pressure . A minimal algorithm is proposed to improve the model s performance . The algorithm utilises a non linear least squares solver to estimate a global set of the parameters to a pressure volume curve at one PEEP level . These global parameters were then subsequently used to estimate other parameters at different pressure volume curves . The accuracy and computational performance of the minimal algorithm is compared to the grid search algorithm for 2 ARDS patient cohorts . The median absolute percentage curve fitting error over all patients for grid search algorithm is 1.40 and for the minimal algorithm is 2.43 . The median computational time for all patients for the grid search algorithm is 394.51s and for the minimal algorithm is 0.72s where a 600 of reduction of computational time was found for the minimal algorithm . The estimated parameters using the minimal algorithm are correlated with the grid search algorithm with median person s correlation of R 0.9 . The model fitting error for the minimal algorithm is higher than the grid search algorithm . However the model was able capture similar trends in physiologically relevant parameters without the loss of important clinical information . The minimal algorithm is less computationally intensive than the grid search algorithm whilst still providing a means of selecting PEEP with only a small increase in model fitting error . The minimal algorithm is able to improve computational performance while maintaining the ability to capture physiological parameters as the grid search algorithm .

This motivated the present work to propose an ABEC based intelligibility measure that could be used to non intrusively predict speech intelligibility in noise using only temporal envelope waveforms extracted from the noise corrupted speech . The proposed ABEC based metric was computed by averaging the correlation coefficients of mean removed envelope waveforms from adjacent frequency bands of the noise corrupted speech . The ABECm measures were evaluated with intelligibility scores obtained from normal hearing listeners presented with sentences corrupted by four types of maskers in a total of 22 conditions . High correlation was obtained between ABECm values and listeners sentence recognition scores and this correlation was comparable to those computed with existing intrusive and non intrusive intelligibility measures .

To overwhelm that anomaly this research aims at proposing an ideal design criteria holistically for all polymeric materials also tend as a functional assessment metric towards perfection i.e . criteria to specify sprue conduit size before mould development . Accordingly a priori analytical criterion was deduced quantitatively as expansion ratio from ubiquitous empirical relationships specifically a.k.a an exclusive expansion angle imperatively configured for injectant properties .

For comprehensiveness it was continuously sensitised over infinite scale as an explicit factor dependent on in situ spatio temporal injectant state perplexity with discrete slope and altitude for each polymeric character . In which congregant ranges of apparent viscosity and shear thinning index were conceived to characteristically assort most thermoplastics .

Residual stresses have been studied elaborately in the past and even in depth research have been done to determine their magnitude and distribution during different manufacturing processes. But very few works have dealt with the study of residual stresses formation during the casting process. Even though these stresses are less in magnitude they still result in crack formation and subsequent failure in later phases of the component usage. In this work the residual stresses developed in a shifter during casting process are first determined by finite element analysis using ANSYS Mechanical APDL Release 12.0 software. Initially the analysis was done on a simple block to determine the optimum element size and boundary conditions. With these values the actual shifter component was analyzed. All these simulations are done in an uncoupled thermal and structural environment. The results showed the areas of maximum residual stress. This was followed by the geometrical optimization of the cast part for minimum residual stresses. The resulting shape gave lesser and more evenly distributed residual stresses. Crack compliance method was used to experimentally determine the residual stresses in the modified cast part. The results obtained from the measurements are verified by finite element analysis findings. \\n'],\n",

Design of future e interventions should consider emphasizing possible benefits of quitting rather than the negative consequences of drug use and when addressing consequences should consider focusing on the impacts of substance use on relationship and financial aspects . These findings are an early but important step toward using process evaluation to optimize e intervention content . \\n'],\n",
              " [' Growth models have the capability of studying change at the group as well as the individual level . In addition these methods have documented advantages over traditional data analytic approaches in the analysis of repeated measures data . These advantages include but are not limited to the ability to incorporate time varying predictors handle dependence among repeated observations in a very flexible manner and to provide accurate estimates with missing data under fairly unrestrictive missing data assumptions . The flexibility of the growth curve modeling approach to the analysis of change makes it the preferred choice in the evaluation of direct indirect and moderated intervention effects . Although offering many benefits growth models present challenges in terms of design analysis and reporting of results . This paper provides a nontechnical overview of growth models in the analysis of change in randomized experiments and advocates for their use in the field of internet interventions . Practical recommendations for design analysis and reporting of results from growth models are provided . \\n'],\n",
              " [' The aim of this pilot study was to explore the effects of an early and customized CBT intervention mainly delivered via internet for adolescents with coexisting recurrent pain and emotional distress . The intervention was based on a transdiagnostic approach to concurrently target pain and emotional distress . A single case experimental design was employed with six participants 17 21years old who were recruited via school health care professionals at the student health care team at an upper secondary school in a small town in Sweden . The intervention consisted of 5 9 modules of CBT delivered via internet in combination with personal contacts and face to face sessions . The content and length of the program was customized depending on needs . The effects of the program were evaluated based on self report inventories which the participants filled out before and after the intervention and at a six month follow up . They did also fill out a diary where they rated symptoms on a daily basis . The results were promising at least when considering changes during the intervention as well as pre and posttest ratings . However the results were more modest when calculating the reliable change index and most of the treatment effects were not sustained at the follow up assessment which raises questions about the durability of the effects . Taken together this study indicates that this type of program is promising as an early intervention for adolescents with pain and concurrent emotional distress although the outcomes need to be explored further especially in terms of long term effects . \\n'],\n",

A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted with 976 Year 9 10 students from twelve Australian secondary schools in 2009 . Four schools were randomly allocated to the Anxiety Internet based prevention programme five schools to the Depression Internet based prevention programme and three to their usual health classes . The Thiswayup Schools for Anxiety and Depression prevention courses were presented over the Internet and consist of 6 7 evidence based curriculum consistent lessons to improve the ability to manage anxiety and depressive symptoms . Participants were assessed at baseline and post intervention . Data analysis was constrained by both study attrition and data corruption . Thus post intervention data were only available for 265 976 students . Compared to the control group students in the depression intervention group showed a significant improvement in anxiety and depressive symptoms at the end of the course whilst students in the anxiety intervention demonstrated a reduction in symptoms of anxiety . No significant differences were found in psychological distress . The Thiswayup Schools Depression and Anxiety interventions appear to reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms in adolescents using a curriculum based blended online and offline cognitive behavioural therapy programme that was implemented by classroom teachers . Given the study limitations particularly the loss of post intervention data these findings can only be considered preliminary and need to be replicated in future research . \\n'],\n",

The purpose was to generate a supplemental control function under the dynamic machining environment where unforeseeable changes may occur frequently . Two different types of membership functions were developed for the fuzzy logic systems and also by combining the two types a hybrid system was generated . Genetic algorithm was used for fuzzy adaptation in the control system . Fuzzy rules are automatically modified in the process of genetic algorithm training . The computational results showed that the hybrid system with a genetic adaptation generated a far better accuracy . The hybrid fuzzy system with genetic algorithm training demonstrated more effective prediction capability and a strong potential for the implementation into existing control functions . \\n'],\n",
              " [' There is evidence from randomized control trials that internet based cognitive behavioral therapy is efficacious in the treatment of anxiety and depression and recent research demonstrates the effectiveness of iCBT in routine clinical care . The aims of this study were to implement and evaluate a new pathway by which patients could access online treatment by completing an automated assessment rather than seeing a specialist health professional . We compared iCBT treatment outcomes in patients who received an automated pre treatment questionnaire assessment with patients who were assessed by a specialist psychiatrist prior to treatment . Participants were treated as part of routine clinical care and were therefore not randomized . The results showed that symptoms of anxiety and depression decreased significantly with iCBT and that the mode of assessment did not affect outcome . That is a pre treatment assessment by a psychiatrist conferred no additional treatment benefits over an automated assessment . These findings suggest that iCBT is effective in routine care and may be implemented with an automated assessment . By providing wider access to evidence based interventions and reducing waiting times the use of iCBT within a stepped care model is a cost effective way to reduce the burden of disease caused by these common mental disorders . \\n'],\n",
              " [' Geriatric depression is a pathological process that causes a great number of symptoms resulting in limited mental and physical functionality . The computation of oscillatory and synchronization patterns in certain brain areas may facilitate the early and robust identification of depressive symptoms . In this study electroencephalographic data were recorded from 34 participants suffering from both cognitive impairment and geriatric depression and 32 control subjects . Both groups were matched according to their cognitive status . The study aims at evaluating neurophysiological features of elderly participants suffering from depression and neurodegeneration . The current work focuses on the identification of depression symptoms that coexist with cognitive decline the correlation of the examined neurophysiological features with geriatric depression combined with cognitive impairment and the investigation of the role of data mining techniques in the analysis of EEG data . The EEG features were estimated through synchronization analysis . Depressive patterns were detected through data mining techniques . Random Forest Random Tree Multilayer Perceptron and Support Vector Machines were employed for data classification . The efficiency of the classifiers varied from 92.42 to 95.45 . Random Forest demonstrated the highest accuracy . Both synchronization and oscillatory features contributed to the decision trees formation with the former prevailing . Moreover synchronization features significantly contributed to the decision trees formation . In line with previous neuroscientific findings synchronization among right frontal midline anteriofrontal regions showed great correlation with depressive symptoms . Evaluation of the classifiers indicated the Random Forest as being the most robust algorithm . Synchronization of certain brain regions is more indicative of identifying depression symptoms than oscillatory since synchronization features contributed the most to the formation of the classification trees . \\n'],\n",

In this paper we will study one of the components of the automotive which is the twist beam . The study is focused on the multicriteria design of the automotive twist beam undergoing linear elastic deformation . Indeed for the design of this automotive part there are some criteria to be considered as the rigidity and the resistance to fatigue . Those two criteria are known to be conflicting therefore our aim is to identify the Pareto front of this problem . To do this we used a Normal Boundary Intersection algorithm coupling with a radial basis function metamodel in order to reduce the high calculation time needed for solving the multicriteria design problem . Otherwise we used the free form deformation technique for the generation of the 3D shapes of the automotive part studied during the optimization process . \\n'],\n",

Grounded theory was used to analyze data from seven in depth interviews with persons who had non adhered to a study on Internet delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for generalized anxiety disorder . The process of non adherence is described as an interaction between patient factors and treatment factors . A working model theory was generated to illustrate the experience of nonadherence . The model describes a process where treatment features such as workload text content complexity and treatment process don t match personal prerequisites regarding daily routines perceived language skills and treatment expectations respectively resulting in the decision to nonadhere .

The electrical potentials generated by the excitatory and inhibitory neuron populations are described by nonlinear coupled partial differential equations that are known to generate complicated spatio temporal behaviour . We focus on the model by Liley et al . 67 113 . Several reductions of this model have been studied in detail but a direct analysis of its spatio temporal dynamics has to the best of our knowledge never been attempted before . Here we describe the implementation of implicit time stepping of the model and the tangent linear model and solving for equilibria and time periodic solutions using the open source library PETSc . By using domain decomposition for parallelization and iterative solving of linear problems the code is capable of parsing some dynamics of a macroscopic slice of cortical tissue with a sub millimetre resolution . \\n'],\n",

These specific images are characterized by a more complex background than in shorter wavelengths with a higher level of noise more noticeable flux variations and both unresolved and extended sources with a higher dynamic range . In order to improve the source detection efficiency in long wavelength images in this paper we present a new approach based on the combined use of a multiscale decomposition and a recently developed method called Distilled Sensing . Its application minimizes the impact of the contaminants from the background unveiling and highlighting the sources at the same time . The experimental results achieved using infrared and radio images illustrate the good performance of the approach identifying greater percentages of true sources than using both the widely used SExtractor algorithm and the Distilled Sensing method alone . \\n'],\n",

This paper presents the fuzzy clustering based event wise multiple linearized modeling approaches for HDS to describe the continuous dynamic in each event . In the present work a fuzzy clustering validation approach is presented for the selection of number of linearized models which span entire HDS . The method also describes how to obtain event wise operating point using fuzzy membership function which is used to find the event wise model bank by linearizing the first principles model . The event wise linearized models are used for the formulation of the optimal control law . The HJB equation is formulated using a suitable quadratic term in the objective function . By use of the direct method of Lyapunov stability the control law is shown to be optimal with respect to objective functional and stabilized the event wise linearized models . The global Lyapunov function is proposed with discrete variables which stabilized the HDS . The proposed modeling and control algorithm have been applied on two HDSs . Necessary theoretical and simulation experiments are presented to demonstrate the performance and validation of the proposed algorithm . \\n',\n",
              "       ' Mechanical stimuli play a significant role in the process of long bone development as evidenced by clinical observations and in vivo studies . Up to now approaches to understand stimuli characteristics have been limited to the first stages of epiphyseal development . Furthermore growth plate mechanical behavior has not been widely studied . In order to better understand mechanical influences on bone growth we used Carter and Wong biomechanical approximation to analyze growth plate mechanical behavior and explore stress patterns for different morphological stages of the growth plate . To the best of our knowledge this work is the first attempt to study stress distribution on growth plate during different possible stages of bone development from gestation to adolescence . Stress distribution analysis on the epiphysis and growth plate was performed using axisymmetric finite element analysis in a simplified generic epiphyseal geometry using a linear elastic model as the first approximation . We took into account different growth plate locations morphologies and widths as well as different epiphyseal developmental stages . We found stress distribution during bone development established osteogenic index patterns that seem to influence locally epiphyseal structures growth and coincide with growth plate histological arrangement . \\n',\n",
              "       ' The assessment of the state of the acrosome is a priority in artificial insemination centres since it is one of the main causes of function loss . In this work boar spermatozoa present in gray scale images acquired with a phase contrast microscope have been classified as acrosome intact or acrosome damaged after using fluorescent images for creating the ground truth . Based on shape prior criteria combined with Otsu s thresholding regional minima and watershed transform the spermatozoa heads were segmented and registered . One of the main novelties of this proposal is that unlike what previous works stated the obtained results show that the contour information of the spermatozoon head is important for improving description and classification . Other of this work novelties is that it confirms that combining different texture descriptors and contour descriptors yield the best classification rates for this problem up to date . The classification was performed with a Support Vector Machine backed by a Least Squares training algorithm and a linear kernel . Using the biggest acrosome intact damaged dataset ever created the early fusion approach followed provides a 0.9913 F Score outperforming all previous related works . \\n',\n",

              "       ' Considering the inherent connection between supplier selection and inventory management in supply chain networks this article presents a multi period inventory lot sizing model for a single product in a serial supply chain where raw materials are purchased from multiple suppliers at the first stage and external demand occurs at the last stage . The demand is known and may change from period to period . The stages of this production distribution serial structure correspond to inventory locations . The first two stages stand for storage areas for raw materials and finished products in a manufacturing facility and the remaining stages symbolize distribution centers or warehouses that take the product closer to customers . The problem is modeled as a time expanded transshipment network which is defined by the nodes and arcs that can be reached by feasible material flows . A mixed integer nonlinear programming model is developed to determine an optimal inventory policy that coordinates the transfer of materials between consecutive stages of the supply chain from period to period while properly placing purchasing orders to selected suppliers and satisfying customer demand on time . The proposed model minimizes the total variable cost including purchasing production inventory and transportation costs . The model can be linearized for certain types of cost structures . In addition two continuous and concave approximations of the transportation cost function are provided to simplify the model and reduce its computational time . \\n',\n",
              "       ' Background Structural changes of the brain s third ventricle have been acknowledged as an indicative measure of the brain atrophy progression in neurodegenerative and endocrinal diseases . To investigate the ventricular enlargement in relation to the atrophy of the surrounding structures shape analysis is a promising approach . However there are hurdles in modeling the third ventricle shape . First it has topological variations across individuals due to the inter thalamic adhesion . In addition as an interhemispheric structure it needs to be aligned to the midsagittal plane to assess its asymmetric and regional deformation . Method To address these issues we propose a model based shape assessment . Our template model of the third ventricle consists of a midplane and a symmetric mesh of generic shape . By mapping the template s midplane to the individuals brain midsagittal plane we align the symmetric mesh on the midline of the brain before quantifying the third ventricle shape . To build the vertex wise correspondence between the individual third ventricle and the template mesh we employ a minimal distortion surface deformation framework . In addition to account for topological variations we implement geometric constraints guiding the template mesh to have zero width where the inter thalamic adhesion passes through preventing vertices crossing between left and right walls of the third ventricle . The individual shapes are compared using a vertex wise deformity from the symmetric template . Results Experiments on imaging and demographic data from a study of aging showed that our model was sensitive in assessing morphological differences between individuals in relation to brain volume gender and the fluid intelligence at age 72 . It also revealed that the proposed method can detect the regional and asymmetrical deformation unlike the conventional measures volume and width of the third ventricle . Similarity measures between binary masks and the shape model showed that the latter reconstructed shape details with high accuracy . Conclusions We have demonstrated that our approach is suitable to morphometrical analyses of the third ventricle providing high accuracy and inter subject consistency in the shape quantification . This shape modeling method with geometric constraints based on anatomical landmarks could be extended to other brain structures which require a consistent measurement basis in the morphometry . \\n',\n",
              "       ' Sample variations are one of the main problems associated with speaker recognition . Most approaches use multiple templates in the gallery database . But this requires enormous memory space . In order to minimize classification errors and intra class variations adaptive online and offline template update methods using vector quantization and Gaussian mixture model are proposed . Online and offline feature update as well as model update techniques are considered here . Feature update utilizes the vector quantization approach while Gaussian mixture model approach is considered for model updating . The proposed methods automatically update the feature in accordance with the biometric sample variations over time and they continually adapt the templates based on semi supervised learning strategies . Experiments with 50 subjects reveal that the proposed template update strategies improve the recognition accuracy and reduce the classification errors for voice recognition systems even under sample variations . \\n'],\n",
