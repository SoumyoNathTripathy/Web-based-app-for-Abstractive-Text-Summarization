S0010448513001553," ""We explore the notion of a Well spaced Blue noise Distribution WBD of points which combines two desirable properties. First the point distribution is random as measured by its spectrum having blue noise. Second it is well spaced in the sense that the minimum separation distance between samples is large compared to the maximum coverage distance between a domain point and a sample i.e. its Voronoi cell aspect ratios are small. It is well known that maximizing one of these properties destroys the other uniform random points have no aspect ratio bound and the vertices of an equilateral triangular tiling have no randomness. However we show that there is a lot of room in the middle to get good values for both. Maximal Poisson disk sampling provides and blue noise. We show that a standard optimization technique can improve the well spacedness while preserving randomness. Given a random point set our Opt beta algorithm iterates over the points and for each point locally optimizes its Voronoi cell aspect ratio . It can improve to a large fraction of the theoretical bound given by a structured tiling improving from 1.0 to around 0.8 about half way to 0.58 while preserving most of the randomness of the original set. In terms of both and randomness the output of Opt compares favorably to alternative point improvement techniques such as centroidal Voronoi tessellation with a constant density function which do not target directly. We demonstrate the usefulness of our output through meshing and filtering applications. An open problem is constructing from scratch a WBD distribution with a guarantee of beta 1.""",the point distribution is random as measured by its spectrum having blue noise . it is well spaced in the sense that the minimum separation distance between samples is large . the vertices of an equilateral triangular tiling have no randomness .
S0010448513002418," ""3D garments are created by assembling 2D patterns on human models in current mainstream garment modeling methods which usually calls for professional design skills. The high coupling between the 2D pattern making and 3D garment design blocks the designers creations. In this paper a novel approach that decouples the high coupling between garment design and pattern making is proposed. Our approach is examples based. 3D new garment models are created on individual human models by compositing 3D parts from garment examples rather than 2D patterns. The main benefit of our approach is that it is easy to operate and capable to create elegant individualized garments with highly detailed geometries. Garment prototypes represented in Coons surface automatically generated from individual human models are used to guide the garment parts composition and locally parameterize the garment parts. With the local parameterization the garment parts and the newly created garment models can be interactively edited by altering the parametric curves on the garment prototypes. Our approach makes it possible for both the designers and the common customers to express their creations and imaginations conveniently in a 3D graphical way.""",a novel approach that decouples the high coupling between garment design and pattern making is proposed . 3D new garment models are created on individual human models . the main benefit of our approach is that it is easy to operate .
S0010448513001644," ""We present a novel approach to feature aware mesh deformation . Previous mesh editing methods are based on an elastic deformation model and thus tend to uniformly distribute the distortion in a least squares sense over the entire deformation region . Recent results from image resizing however show that discrete local modifications such as deleting or adding connected seams of image pixels in regions with low saliency lead to far superior preservation of local features compared to uniform scaling the image retargeting analog to least squares mesh deformation . Hence we propose a discrete mesh editing scheme that combines elastic as well as plastic deformation by transferring the concept of seam carving from image retargeting to the mesh deformation scenario . A geometry seam consists of a connected strip of triangles within the mesh s deformation region . By collapsing or splitting the interior edges of this strip we perform a deletion or insertion operation that is equivalent to image seam carving and can be interpreted as a local plastic deformation . We use a feature measure to rate the geometric saliency of each triangle in the mesh and a well adjusted distortion measure to determine where the current mesh distortion asks for plastic deformations i.e . for deletion or insertion of geometry seams . Precomputing a fixed set of low saliency seams in the deformation region allows us to perform fast seam deletion and insertion operations in a predetermined order such that the local mesh modifications are properly restored when a mesh editing operation is undone . Geometry seam carving hence enables the deformation of a given mesh in a way that causes stronger distortion in homogeneous mesh regions while salient features are preserved much better .""",previous mesh editing methods tend to uniformly distribute the distortion in a least squares sense over the entire deformation region . recent results from image resizing however show that discrete local modifications such as deleting or adding connected seams of image pixels lead to far superior preservation of local features .
S0010448514000268," ""This paper presents an algorithm for decomposing complex line drawings which depict connected 3D manifolds into multiple simpler drawings of individual manifolds . The decomposition process has three stages decomposition at non manifold vertices along non manifold edges and across internal faces . Once non manifold vertices and or edges are found the decomposition can be performed straightforwardly . Thus the major task in this paper is decomposition across internal faces . This has two steps basic decomposition and repair of incomplete parts . The decomposition process is performed before face identification which is computationally expensive . After decomposition the time for face finding is much reduced and this in turn greatly improves the process for 3D reconstruction which is the ultimate goal .""",algorithm decomposes complex 3D manifolds into simpler drawings . the major task in this paper is decomposition across internal faces . after face finding the time for face finding is much reduced .
S0010448513001413," ""We present a new hybrid method for solving constrained numerical and engineering optimization problems in this paper . The proposed hybrid method takes advantage of the differential evolution ability to find global optimum in problems with complex design spaces while directly enforcing feasibility of constraints using a modified augmented Lagrangian multiplier method . The basic steps of the proposed method are comprised of an outer iteration in which the Lagrangian multipliers and various penalty parameters are updated using a first order update scheme and an inner iteration in which a nonlinear optimization of the modified augmented Lagrangian function with simple bound constraints is implemented by a modified differential evolution algorithm . Experimental results based on several well known constrained numerical and engineering optimization problems demonstrate that the proposed method shows better performance in comparison to the state of the art algorithms .""",the proposed method takes advantage of the differential evolution ability to find global optimum in problems with complex design spaces . a modified augmented Lagrangian function with simple bound constraints is implemented .
S0010448513001036," ""In most cases designers have to manually specify both assembly tolerance types and values when they design a mechanical product . Different designers will possibly specify different assembly tolerance types and values for the same nominal geometry . Furthermore assembly tolerance specification design of a complex product is a highly collaborative process in which semantic interoperability issues significantly arise . These situations will cause the uncertainty in assembly tolerance specification design and finally affect the quality of the product . In order to reduce the uncertainty and to support the semantic interoperability in assembly tolerance specification design an ontology based approach for automatically generating assembly tolerance types is proposed . First of all an extended assembly tolerance representation model is constructed by introducing a spatial relation layer . The constructed model is hierarchically organized and consists of part layer assembly feature surface layer and spatial relation layer . All these layers are defined with Web Ontology Language assertions . Next a meta ontology for assembly tolerance representations is constructed . With this meta ontology the domain specific assembly tolerance representation knowledge can be derived by reusing or inheriting the classes or properties . Based on this assembly tolerance representation knowledge is formalized using OWL . As a result assembly tolerance representation knowledge has well defined semantics due to the logic based semantics of OWL making it possible to automatically detect inconsistencies of assembly tolerance representation knowledge bases . The mapping relations between spatial relations and assembly tolerance types are represented in Semantic Web Rule Language . Furthermore actual generation processes of assembly tolerance types are carried out using Java Expert System Shell by mapping OWL based structure knowledge and SWRL based constraint knowledge into JESS facts and JESS rules respectively . Based on this an approach for automatically generating assembly tolerance types is proposed . Finally the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by a practical example .""","""In most cases designers have to manually specify both assembly tolerance types and values when they design a mechanical product .
